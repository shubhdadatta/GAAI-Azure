    "# RAG Evaluation Using RAGAS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluation in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems involves assessing the performance of both the retrieval component (how well relevant documents are fetched from a knowledge base)\n",
    "and the generation component (how accurate, relevant, and coherent the generated responses are). A RAG system combines a retriever (e.g., a vector store like FAISS) with a language model (e.g., AzureChatOpenAI) to provide contextually informed responses, reducing issues like hallucinations (incorrect or fabricated information).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Use Evaluation?\n",
    "- Evaluation is critical for the following reasons:\n",
    "- Quality Assurance: Ensures the RAG system delivers accurate, relevant, and trustworthy responses.\n",
    "- System Improvement: Identifies weaknesses in retrieval (e.g., irrelevant documents) or generation (e.g., unfaithful answers), guiding optimizations like better embeddings or prompt engineering.\n",
    "- Performance Monitoring: Quantifies system performance to track improvements or regressions over time.\n",
    "- Stakeholder Confidence: Provides metrics to demonstrate the system's reliability to stakeholders or end-users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The RAGAS framework (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) is used to evaluate RAG systems. It provides metrics like:\n",
    "- Faithfulness: Measures if the generated answer is factually grounded in the retrieved context.\n",
    "- Answer Relevancy: Assesses if the answer directly addresses the user's query.\n",
    "- Context Precision: Checks if the retrieved context contains relevant information with minimal noise.\n",
    "- Context Recall: Ensures all necessary information is retrieved (requires ground truth).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook sets up a RAG system using AzureChatOpenAI, AzureOpenAIEmbeddings, and FAISS, generates a synthetic test dataset, and evaluates the system using RAGAS."

What is the pur-\\npose of a supply chain?\\nLogistics is a big word for a big challenge. Let us begin by giving an example of\\nthat challenge in practice, because that is where logistics starts and ends.\\n4\\nChapter 1 • Logistics and the supply chain\\nTesco\\nTesco is the UK’s largest food retailer, with a sales turnover of more than €67.5 billion.\\nWhile it has some 638 stores in central Europe, and some 636 in the Far East, most are\\nin the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, where it has nearly 1,800. This number\\nhas increased rapidly as Tesco entered the convenience store market with deals such as\\nthe Tesco Express alliance with Esso to run grocery shops at petrol stations. The prod-\\nuct range held by the stores has grown rapidly in recent years, and currently stands at\\n65,000 stock-keeping units (skus) depending on the size of the store as Tesco broadens\\nits presence in the ‘non-food’ market for electrical goods, stationery, clothing and the\\nlike. This massive range is supported by 3,000 suppliers, who are expected to provide\\nservice levels (correct time and quantities) of at least 98.5 per cent by delivering to\\nTesco within half-hour time ‘windows’. Volumes are equally impressive. In a year, some\\n2.5 billion cases of product are shipped from suppliers to the stores.\\nTesco states that its core purpose is ‘to create value for customers to earn their life-\\ntime loyalty’. Wide product range and high on-shelf availability across that range are\\nkey enablers of that core purpose. So how do you maintain high availability of so many\\nskus in so many stores? This question goes to the heart of logistics management for\\nsuch a vast organisation. Logistics is about material ﬂow, and about information ﬂow.\\nLet us look at how Tesco deals with each of these in turn.\\nAn early reform for supermarket operation was to have suppliers deliver to a distri-\\nbution centre rather than to every store. During the 1980s, distribution to retail stores\\nwas handled by 26 depots. These operated on a single-temperature basis, and were\\nsmall and relatively inefﬁcient. Delivery volumes to each store were also relatively low,\\nand it was not economic to deliver to all stores each day. Goods that required tem-\\nperature-controlled environments had to be carried on separate vehicles. Each product\\ngroup had different ordering systems. The network of depots simply could not handle\\nCASE STUDY\\n1.1'),\n",

A\\nnew distribution strategy was needed.\\nUnder the ‘composite’ distribution system, many small depots with limited tempera-\\nture control facilities were replaced by composite distribution centres (called regional\\ndistribution centres, RDCs), which can handle many products at several temperature\\nranges. The opportunity is to provide a cost-effective daily delivery service to all stores.\\nTypically, a composite distribution centre can handle over 60 million cases per year on\\na 15-acre site. The warehouse building comprises 25,000 square metres divided into\\nthree temperature zones: frozen (\\x0225°C), \\x032°C (chilled) and \\x0312°C (semi-ambient).\\nEach distribution centre (DC) serves a group of between 100 and 140 retail stores.\\nDelivery vehicles for composite depots can use insulated trailers divided into chambers\\nby means of movable bulkheads so they can operate at different temperatures.\\nDeliveries are made at agreed, scheduled times. Ambient goods such as cans and cloth-\\ning are delivered through a separate grocery distribution network which relies on a\\nstocked environment where orders are picked by store. This operation is complemented\\nby a strategically located trunking station which operates a pick to zero operation for\\nfast-moving grocery on merchandise units that can be placed directly on the shop ﬂoor.\\nSo much for the method of transporting goods from supplier through to the stores,\\nbut how much should be sent to each store? With such a huge product range today, it\\nis impossible for the individual store to reorder across the whole range (store-based\\nordering). Instead, sales of each product line are tracked continuously through the till\\nby means of electronic point of sale (EPOS) systems. As a customer’s purchases are\\nscanned through the bar code reader at the till, the sale is automatically recorded for\\neach sku. Cumulative sales are updated every four hours on Tesco Information\\nExchange (TIE). This is a system based on Internet Protocol that allows Tesco and its\\nsuppliers to communicate trading information. The aim of improved communication is\\nto reduce response times from manufacturer to stores and to ensure product availability\\non the shelf. Among other things, TIE aims to improve processes for introducing new\\nproducts and promotions, and to monitor service levels.\\nBased on the cumulative sales, Tesco places orders with its suppliers by means of elec-\\ntronic data interchange (EDI). As volumes and product ranges increased during the\\n1990s, food retailers such as Tesco aimed to destock their distribution centres by order-\\ning only what was needed to meet tomorrow’s forecast sales. For fast-moving products\\nsuch as types of cheese and washing powders, the aim is day 1 for day 2: that is, to\\norder today what is needed for tomorrow. For fast-moving products, the aim is to pick\\nto zero in the distribution centre: no stock is left after store orders have been fulﬁlled\\nand deliveries to stores are made as soon as the product is picked, which increases the\\nstock availability for the customer. The ﬂow of the product into the distribution centre\\nis broken into four waves and speciﬁc products are delivered in different cycles through\\nthe day. This means that the same space in the distribution centre can be used several\\ntimes over.\\nQuestions\\n1 Describe the key logistics processes at Tesco.\\n2 What do you think are the main logistics challenges in running the Tesco operation?'),\n",

In order to\\nachieve loyalty, Tesco has to understand customer needs and how they can be\\nserved. Its products must be recognised by its customers as representing out-\\nstanding value for money. To support such goals, it must ensure that the prod-\\nucts that its customers want are available on the shelf at each of its stores at all\\ntimes, day and night. Planning and controlling the purchase and distribution of\\nTesco’s massive product range from suppliers to stores is one of logistics. Logistics\\nis the task of managing two key ﬂows:\\n●material ﬂow of the physical goods from suppliers through the distribution\\ncentres to stores;\\n●information ﬂow of demand data from the end-customer back to purchasing\\nand to suppliers, and supply data from suppliers to the retailer, so that material\\nﬂow can be accurately planned and controlled.\\nThe logistics task of managing material ﬂow and information ﬂow is a key part\\nof the overall task of supply chain management. Supply chain management is con-\\ncerned with managing the entire chain of processes, including raw material\\nsupply, manufacture, packaging and distribution to the end-customer. The Tesco\\nUK supply chain structure comprises three main functions:\\n●distribution: the operations and support task of managing Tesco’s distribution\\ncentres, and the distribution of products from the DCs to the associated stores;\\n●network and capacity planning: the task of planning and implementing sufﬁ-\\ncient capacity in the supply chain to ensure that the right products can be pro-\\ncured in the right quantities now and in the future;\\n●supply chain development: the task of improving Tesco’s supply chain so that its\\nprocesses are stable and in control, that it is efﬁcient, and that it is correctly\\nstructured to meet the logistics needs of material ﬂow and information ﬂow.\\nThus logistics can be seen as part of the overall supply chain challenge. While the\\nterms ‘logistics’ and ‘supply chain management’ are often used interchangeably,\\nlogistics is actually a subset of supply chain management. It is time for some deﬁ-\\nnitions.\\n1.1.1 Deﬁnitions and concepts\\nA supply chain as a whole ranges from basic commodities (what is in the ground,\\nsea or air) to selling the ﬁnal product to the end-customer to recycling the used\\nproduct. Material ﬂows from a basic commodity (such as a bauxite mine as a\\nsource of aluminium ore) to the ﬁnished product (such as a can of cola). The can\\nis recycled after use. The analogy to the ﬂow of water in a river is often used to\\ndescribe organisations near the source as upstream, and those near the end-cus-\\ntomer as downstream.

A process:\\nTransforms inputs in the form of materials and information into outputs in the\\nform of goods and services.\\nIn the case of the cola can, partners carry out processes such as mining, trans-\\nportation, reﬁning and hot rolling. The cola can has greater value than the baux-\\nite (per kilogram of aluminium).\\nSupply chain management involves planning and controlling all of the processes\\nfrom raw material production to purchase by the end-user to recycling of the\\nused cans. Planning refers to making a plan that deﬁnes how much of each prod-\\nuct should be bought, made, distributed and sold each day, week or month.\\nControlling means keeping to plan – in spite of the many problems that may get\\nin the way. The aim is to coordinate planning and control of each process so that\\nthe needs of the end-customer are met correctly. The deﬁnition of supply chain\\nmanagement used in this book is as follows:\\nPlanning and controlling all of the business processes – from end-customer to raw\\nmaterial suppliers – that link together partners in a supply chain in order to serve\\nthe needs of the end-customer.\\n‘Serve the needs of the end-customer’ has different implications in different con-\\ntexts.

In the commercial sector, serving\\nimplies ‘better than competition’, ‘better value for money’ and so on. In either\\nsituation, the focus of managing the supply chain as a whole is on integrating the\\nprocesses of supply chain partners, of which the end-customer is the key one. In\\neffect, the end-customer starts the whole process by buying ﬁnished products. It\\nis this behaviour that causes materials to ﬂow through the supply chain\\n(Gattorna, 1998: 2).\\nThe degree to which the end-customer is satisﬁed with the ﬁnished product\\ndepends crucially on the management of material ﬂow and information ﬂow\\nalong the supply chain.

Historically, stocks of ﬁnished products had been ‘man-\\naged’ by trying to turn the tap of sales on or off as stocks developed. This was charac-\\nterised by the familiar ‘feast or famine’ situations. The objective of the next move for\\nXerox became clear: making only what you need when you need it, then shipping\\ndirect to the customer. But the key question had to be answered: just-in-time for what?\\nThe answer is – the end-customer. And customer surveys showed that three types of\\ndelivery were needed:\\n●\\nCommodity products should be delivered ‘off the shelf’.\\n●\\nMiddle-range products were required in ﬁve days.\\n●\\nLarger products that had to be integrated into existing customer processes and sys-\\ntems had to be planned months ahead: but the quoted delivery date had to be met\\n100 per cent.\\nIt was envisaged that this would lead to a radically different inventory ‘proﬁle’ in the\\nsupply chain. Figure 1.6 shows a traditional inventory proﬁle on the left. Most of the\\nstock was held in local depots waiting for customer orders. If the mix had been incor-\\nrectly forecast, too many of the wrong products were in plentiful supply, while needed\\nproducts were unavailable. Further, a batch of replacement products would take a long\\ntime to ﬁght their way through the pipeline. A new ‘just-in-time’ strategy was con-\\nceived to make the supply chain much more responsive. This strategy had a profound\\neffect on the inventory proﬁle, pushing much of the inventory away from the end-cus-\\ntomer (where it has maximum added value and is already committed to a given ﬁn-\\nished product speciﬁcation). Instead, inventory was mostly held further upstream,\\nwhere it could be ﬁnally assembled to known orders, and where it had lower value. Of\\ncourse, it has since been possible to remove several of the stages of the distribution\\nprocess, thereby eliminating some of the sources of inventory altogether.\\nFor commodity products, Xerox coined the term deliver JIT: that is, the product had\\nto be delivered out of stock. Where sales forecasts are traditionally poor, the challenge\\nwas one of ﬂexibility, simplicity and speed of manufacture. For mid-range products, it\\nwas unrealistic to hold ‘just in case’ inventories of products that are too complex to be\\nassembled quickly. Instead, ﬁnish JIT was the term coined to describe the new policy of\\nbuilding semi-ﬁnished products with the minimum of added value, consistent with\\nbeing able to complete and deliver the product in the ﬁve-day target.

These are the advantages where supply chain partners ‘dig in deep’ by\\ngiving priority to investment by training and by focusing product development\\nand marketing efforts. They need only to match industry average performance\\non other criteria. Let us now look at the competitive priorities that can be deliv-\\nered by logistics in the supply chain.\\nThere are various ways in which products compete in the marketplace. Perhaps\\na given product is something that no one else can match in terms of price. Or\\nmaybe you offer a product that is technically superior, such as Gillette razor\\nblades. While new product development has logistics implications, the key\\nadvantage provided by logistics – as suggested in the Tesco example in section 1.1\\n– is availability of conforming product in the marketplace at low cost. Logistics sup-\\nports competitiveness of the supply chain as a whole by:\\nmeeting end-customer demand through supplying what is needed in the form it is\\nneeded, when it is needed, at a competitive cost.\\nLogistics advantage thus shows up in the form of such competitive factors as\\nbetter product availability in the marketplace and low product obsolescence.\\nDeﬁning logistics advantage means that we need to set goals that are clear, meas-\\nurable and quantiﬁable. We distinguish three ‘hard objectives’ for creating logis-\\ntics advantage: quality, time and cost. There are two further important ways of\\ncreating logistics advantage: controlling variability in logistics processes, and deal-\\ning with uncertainty. We have called these ‘supportive capabilities’, and they can\\nbe just as important as hard objectives. Finally, there are ‘soft objectives’, which\\nrelate to service aspects such as the conﬁdence customers develop in the way the\\nlogistics operation is performed. Let us look at each of these ways of creating\\nadvantage in turn.\\n1.3.1 Hard objectives\\nTraditional ways of competing are to offer the end-customer advantages related\\nto product quality, the speed with which it is delivered, and/or the price at which\\nit is offered. We refer to quality, time and cost as ‘hard objectives’ because they\\nare easy to measure and relatively obvious to the end-customer.\\nThe quality advantage\\nThe most fundamental objective – in that it is a foundation for the others – is to\\ncarry out all processes across the supply chain so that the end product does what\\nit is supposed to do. Quality is the most visible aspect of supply chain perform-\\nance. Defects, incorrect quantities and wrong items delivered are symptoms of\\nquality problems in supply chain processes that are all too apparent to the end-\\ncustomer. Such problems negatively inﬂuence that customer’s loyalty. Robust\\n16\\nChapter 1 • Logistics and the supply chain'),\n",

Internally, robust pro-\\ncesses help to reduce costs by eliminating errors, and help to increase depend-\\nability by making processes more certain.\\nWhile conformance quality in the factory may be controlled to defect levels\\nthat are below 25 parts per million (ppm), a product may end up on the retailer’s\\nshelf with between 2 and 5 per cent defects, which is 10,000 to 20,000 ppm. This\\nhuge escalation takes place as the result of cumulative problems in successive\\nsupply chain processes. Cases may be squashed when shrink-wrapped at the\\nmanufacturer’s NDC. In the back of the retail store, cases may be cut open with\\na sharp knife – in spite of instructions to the contrary. The end-customer sees the\\nproduct on the retail shelf at its worst state of quality performance, and that is\\nwhere the buying decision is made that drives the supply chain as a whole.\\nIn many logistics situations, quality of service is about selecting the right quan-\\ntity of the right product in the right sequence in response to customer orders. For\\nexample, store orders must be picked from a range of thousands of skus (stock\\nkeeping units) at a Tesco RDC. This must be carried out accurately (correct sku,\\ncorrect quantity) against tight delivery schedules day in day out. Pick accuracy (for\\nexample, 99.5 per cent correct sku and correct quantity) is widely used to\\nmeasure the quality of this operation. And increasing requirements for in-store\\nefﬁciencies mean that categories of product (for example, shampoos and tooth-\\npastes) need to be picked in a set sequence to facilitate direct-to-shelf delivery at\\nthe store. Logistics service providers who can implement and maintain the high-\\nest standards of service quality place themselves at an advantage over those who\\ncannot.\\nThe time advantage\\nTime measures how long a customer has to wait in order to receive a given prod-\\nuct or service. Volkswagen calls this time the customer to customer lead time: that\\nis, the time it takes from the moment a customer places an order to the moment\\nthat customer receives the car he or she speciﬁed. Such lead times can vary from\\nzero (the product is immediately available, such as goods on a supermarket shelf)\\nto months or years (such as the construction of a new building). Competing on\\ntime is about survival of the fastest!\\nTime can be used to win orders by companies who have learned that some cus-\\ntomers do not want to wait – and are prepared to pay a premium to get what they\\nwant quickly. An example is Vision Express, which offers prescription spectacles\\n‘in about one hour’. Technicians machine lenses from blanks on the premises.\\nStaff are given incentives to maintain a 95 per cent service level against the one-\\nhour target. Vision Express has been successful in the marketplace by re-engin-\\neering the supply chain so that parts and information can ﬂow rapidly from one\\nprocess to the next. Compare this with other opticians in the high street, who\\nmust send customer orders to a central factory. Under the ‘remote factory’\\nsystem, orders typically take about 10 days to process. An individual customer\\norder is ﬁrst dispatched to the factory. It then has to join a queue with orders\\nfrom all the other high street branches around the country.

Time\\nis an absolute measure, that is, it is not open to interpretation like quality and\\ncost. By following a product through a supply chain, we can discover which pro-\\ncesses add value and which add time and cost but no value. We explore this fur-\\nther in Chapter 5, which is about managing time for advantage in the supply\\nchain.\\nThe cost advantage\\nCost is important for all supply chain processes – that goes without saying. Low\\ncosts translate into advantages in the marketplace in terms of low prices or high\\nmargins, or a bit of each. Many products compete speciﬁcally on the basis of low\\nprice. This is supported from a supply chain point of view by low cost manufac-\\nture, distribution, servicing and the like. Examples of products that compete on\\nlow price are ‘own brand’ supermarket goods that reduce the high margins and\\nheavy advertising spend of major brands. They also perhaps cut some of the cor-\\nners in terms of product speciﬁcation in the hope that the customer will consider\\nlow price to be more important than minor differences in product quality.\\nThe pressure to reduce prices at automotive component suppliers is intense.\\nThe assemblers have been setting annual price reduction targets for their\\ninbound supply chains for some years. Unless a supplier can match reduced\\nprices at which products are being sold by means of reduced costs, that supplier\\nwill gradually go out of business. As a result, many suppliers are cynical about the\\n‘price down’ policies of the assemblers. Reduced prices are the reward of cost cut-\\nting, and that is most often a collaborative effort by several partners in the supply\\nchain. As indicated in section 1.1, Tesco can make only limited inroads into its\\nin-store costs without the help of its supply chain partners. On the other hand,\\nsmall dairy farmers continue to be forced out of business because the price of\\nmilk paid by supermarkets is ‘less than the price of water’. For them, there are few\\nopportunities to cut costs.\\n1.3.2 Supportive capabilities\\nWhile the hard objectives listed above are always important to competitive\\nadvantage, supportive capabilities can also be key to creating logistics advantage\\nin the marketplace. When there is little to choose in terms of quality, time or\\ncost, supportive capabilities can make all the difference to the end-customer.\\nVariability refers to real and identiﬁable differences within a population, such as\\nthe differences in time each patient at an optician has to wait for their eyes to be\\ntested.

Quality is not just about meeting defect targets.\\nBehind both ‘hard’ objectives is the need to control variability in logistics pro-\\ncesses. Variability undermines the dependability with which a product or service\\nmeets target. While Vision Express offers a one-hour service for prescription\\nglasses, the 95 per cent service level is a measure of the dependability of that serv-\\nice against the one-hour target. Firms who do not offer instantaneous availability\\nneed to tell the customer – in other words to ‘promise’ – when the product or serv-\\nice will be delivered. Delivery dependability measures how successful the ﬁrm has\\nbeen in meeting those promises. For example, the UK’s Royal Mail offers a ‘ﬁrst\\nclass’ service for letters whereby there is a 90 per cent probability that a letter\\nposted today will reach its destination tomorrow. It is important to measure\\ndependability in the same ‘end to end’ way that speed is measured.\\nDependability measures are widely used in industries such as train and air travel\\nservices to monitor how well published timetables are met. And in manufactur-\\ning ﬁrms, dependability is used to monitor a supplier’s performance in such\\nterms as:\\n●on time (percentage of orders delivered on time, and the variability against\\ntarget);\\n●in full (percentage of orders delivered complete, and the variability against\\ntarget);\\n●on quality (percentage of defects, and the variability against target).\\nSo logistics is concerned not just with the average percentage of orders delivered\\non time but also with the variability. For example, a manufacturer has to cope\\nwith the day-to-day variability of orders placed. In practice, this is more import-\\nant than the average orders placed because of the resource implications of ‘ups\\nand downs’ in demand. Case study 1.3 explores the impact of variability on a\\nsupplier’s processes.\\nCompeting through logistics\\n19\\nMeasuring schedule variability\\nA problem that is all too familiar to suppliers in the automotive industry is that of sched-\\nule variability. A vehicle manufacturer issues delivery schedules to specify how many\\nparts of each type are required each day for the following month. And each day a ‘call-\\noff’ quantity is issued, which speciﬁes how many the vehicle manufacturer actually\\nwants. The two sets of ﬁgures are not necessarily the same, although they usually add\\nup to the same cumulative numbers for the month as a whole. In other words, the total\\nscheduled quantities and the total call-off quantities are the same. So what is the prob-\\nlem?\\nThe problem is that the supplier has to cope with ups and downs of call-off quantities\\nthat create huge problems for the supplier’s process. Let scheduled demand = S, and\\ncall-off quantities \\x04 A. Then the difference D between schedule and actual is given by\\nD = S – A.

While Philips initially rejected offers of help\\nfrom Nokia, it soon became apparent that production delays would be much more\\nthan one week. Korhonen put together a team to ﬁnd solutions to supplying the ﬁve\\nchips that were affected by the Philips ﬁre. Three were quickly re-sourced from Japanese\\nand American suppliers, but the other two were only supplied by Philips. This time\\nPhilips cooperated at the highest level.

Factories at Eindhoven and at Shanghai were rescheduled to\\nsupply the missing chips, and engineers from both Nokia and Philips worked to accel-\\nerate the return of the Albuquerque plant to full production. As a result of these inten-\\nsive efforts, there were relatively minor delays to Nokia’s cellphone shipments.\\nExecutives at Ericsson in Sweden only learned of the problem several weeks after the\\nﬁre.

Finished cars do not accumulate in disused airﬁelds across Europe,\\nlike those of the mass producers. Finished product storage adds cost, with no\\nvalue added from an end-customer perspective.\\n1.3.4 Order winners and qualiﬁers\\nThe relative importance of the above logistics performance objectives is usually\\ndifferent for a given product or service. A helpful distinction is that between\\norder winners and order qualiﬁers (Hill, 2000):\\n●Order winners are factors that directly and signiﬁcantly help products to win\\norders in the marketplace. Customers regard such factors as key reasons for\\nbuying that product or service. If a ﬁrm raises its performance on those factors,\\nit will increase its chances of getting more business. Thus a product that com-\\npetes mainly on price would beneﬁt in the marketplace if productivity\\nimprovements enabled further price reductions.\\n●Order qualiﬁers are factors that are regarded by the market as an ‘entry ticket’.\\nUnless the product or service meets basic performance standards, it will not be\\ntaken seriously. An example is quality accreditation: a possible supplier to\\nmajor utilities such as PowerGen in Britain and EDF in France would not be\\nconsidered seriously without ISO 9000 certiﬁcation. And delivery reliability is\\na must for newspapers – yesterday’s news is worthless. Note that, in both\\nexamples, order qualiﬁers are order-losing sensitive: loss of ISO 9000 accredita-\\ntion would make it impossible to supply to major utilities, and late delivery of\\nnewspapers would miss the market.\\nThe different impacts of the two sets of criteria are illustrated in Figure 1.10.\\nIncreased performance in an order winner, shown by the solid line, increases\\nCompeting through logistics\\n23'),\n",

Of the two, the range\\nof fashion blouses presents more logistics challenges because demand for indi-\\nvidual skus are much more difﬁcult to forecast. It is not until the season is under\\nway that a picture begins to emerge about which colours are selling most in\\nwhich region of the market. The logistics challenge is therefore concerned with\\nspeed of response and ﬂexibility to changing demand. The logistics challenges\\nbetween the two ranges are quite distinctive.\\nNot only can order winners and qualiﬁers be different for different products\\nand services. They can also change over time. Thus, in the early phase of a new\\nproduct life cycle, such as the launch of a new integrated circuit, the order win-\\nners are availability and design performance. Price would often be a qualiﬁer:\\nprovided the price is not so exorbitant that no one can afford it, there is a market\\nfor innovators who want the best-performing chip that is available. But by the\\nmaturity phase of the life cycle, competitors have emerged, the next generation\\nis already on the stocks, and the order winners have changed to price and prod-\\nuct reliability.

It is about formulating a long-\\nterm plan for the supply chain, as distinct from solving the day-to-day issues and\\nproblems that inevitably occur. Extending the concept of ‘strategy’ from Hayes\\nand Wheelwright (1984), \\nLogistics strategy is the set of guiding principles, driving forces and ingrained atti-\\ntudes that help to coordinate goals, plans and policies, and which are reinforced\\nthrough conscious and subconscious behaviour within and between partners across\\na network.\\nAll too often, logistics ‘strategy’ is set using few such characteristics: decisions are\\nmade piecemeal by accident, muddle or inertia. We need, however, to recognise\\nthat strategic decisions may indeed be made by such means.\\nWhittington (2000) proposes four approaches to setting strategy. He starts by\\nsuggesting different motivations for setting strategy:\\n●How deliberate are the processes of strategy setting? These can range from clearly\\nand carefully planned to a series of ad hoc decisions taken on a day-to-day\\nbasis.\\n●What are the goals of strategy setting? These can range from a focus on max-\\nimising proﬁt to allowing other business priorities such as sales growth to be\\nincluded.\\nIf we make these two considerations the axes of a matrix, Figure 1.11 suggests\\nfour options for crafting strategy.\\n26\\nChapter 1 • Logistics and the supply chain\\nStrategy process\\nDay-to-day\\nPlanned\\nAccommodate\\nSystemic\\nEvolve\\nClassical\\nStrategy goals\\nProfit\\nSeveral\\nFigure 1.11\\nFour options for crafting strategy\\nWhat are the implications for the way in which supply chain strategy is\\napproached in different organisations?

Operating decisions are\\ntaken in relation to the needs of the moment, with ﬁnancial goals as the main\\nguiding principle.\\n●Classical. While ﬁnancial goals are again the main guiding principle, these are\\nachieved through a formal planning process. This is called ‘classical’ because it\\nis the oldest and most inﬂuential option.\\n●Accommodate. Here, decisions are back to the day-to-day mode, but ﬁnancial\\nobjectives are no longer the primary concern. Strategy is accommodated\\ninstead to the realities of the focal ﬁrm and the markets in which it operates.\\n●Systemic. This option for strategy setting sees no conﬂict between the ends and\\nmeans of realising business goals. While goal setting takes place across all\\nmajor aspects of the business (including human resources, marketing and\\nmanufacturing policies), these are linked to the means by which they will be\\nachieved in practice.\\nLogistics strategy usually demands systemic strategy setting between network\\npartners, who may have to coordinate order winners and qualiﬁers across differ-\\nent market segments.\\n1.4.2 Aligning strategies\\nIn section 1.1 we showed the supply chain as a network of operating processes.\\nIn section 1.2 we emphasised the need to ‘integrate’ these processes to maximise\\nﬂow and focus on the end-customer. And in section 1.3 we saw how supply\\nchains can choose to compete on a range of different competitive priorities. Now\\nit is time to put these ideas together and show how strategies need to be aligned\\nacross the supply chain.\\nIf different links in the supply chain are directed towards different competitive\\npriorities, then the chain will not be able to serve the end-customer as well as a\\nsupply chain in which the links are directed towards the same priorities. That is\\nthe basic argument for alignment in the supply chain (Cousins, 2005). Where the\\nlinks are directed by a common and consistent set of competitive criteria, then\\nthat supply chain will compete better in the marketplace than one in which the\\nlinks have different, conﬂicting priorities. This is the concept of ‘focus’.\\nFocus is based on the view that you cannot be good at everything. For example,\\nit is difﬁcult to handle high volume, low cost products in the same channel to\\nmarket as low volume, high variety products, for which ﬂexibility is the name of\\nthe game. While the assembly line is the method of choice for manufacturing\\ncars in volume, development of prototypes for new models is kept well away\\nfrom the factory in special facilities until close to launch. This is because the\\ndevelopment process demands quite different technical skills and equipment\\nthat are better physically separated from the more routine, efﬁcient and repeti-\\ntive assembly line. In the example of the standard shirts and fashion blouses in\\nsection 1.3, the associated operations processes would be kept separate (‘focused’)\\nfor similar reasons.

TA attends to broken-down vehicles,\\nproviding a roadside repair and recovery service.

Starters and alternators were\\nobtained from a remanufacturer, who replaced the windings and tested the products\\nusing parts bought from a component supplier. A diagram of this part of the supply\\nchain is shown in Figure 1.12.\\nMost of TA’s customers made ‘distress purchases’ – their car had broken down and\\nthey wanted it to be ﬁxed quickly. So TA needed a fast replacement service from the\\nlocal distributor. While the distributors both recognised the need for fast replacements,\\nthe performance of the purchasing department at the remanufacturer was measured on\\ncost savings. Thus the component supplier thought that the name of the game was low\\ncost.\\n(Source: Harland, 1997)\\nQuestions\\n1 What were the order winners and order qualiﬁers at TA?\\n2 What were the order winners and order qualiﬁers at the component supplier?\\n3 What impact on customer service was this mismatch likely to cause?\\nCASE STUDY\\n1.4\\nComponent\\nsupplier\\nRemanufacturer\\nPrime\\ndistributor\\nLocal\\ndistributor\\nInstaller\\n• Talleres Auto is the installer\\n• TA buys starters and alternators from a local distributor\\n• the local distributor buys from a prime distributor\\n• the prime distributor buys from a remanufacturer\\n• the remanufacturer buys components from a component supplier\\nFigure 1.12\\nThe Talleres Auto supply chain\\n1.4.3 Differentiating strategies\\nA supply chain, then, may choose to compete on different criteria.

The choices so made have major implications for\\nthe operation of each member. Failure to recognise competitive criteria and their\\nimplications for a given product or service by any member means that the supply\\nchain will compete less effectively. It is like playing football when the goalkeeper\\nmakes an error and lets in a goal that should not have happened – s/he lets the\\nwhole side down.\\nWhat makes a successful strategy? Five principles of strategic positioning,\\nrelated to logistics strategy, are as follows (after Porter, 1984):\\n●A unique value proposition: determining what makes the product/service differ-\\nent from its competitors.\\n●A tailored supply chain: governed by consistent order winning and qualifying\\ncriteria.\\n●Identify the trade-offs: by choosing not just the priorities but also what not to\\ndo. A responsive supply chain is not compatible with an efﬁcient supply chain\\n(Fisher, 1997).\\n●Align logistics processes: so that processes are mutually reinforcing.\\n●Continuity: logistics processes are continually and consistently improved over\\ntime.\\nTo reinforce the issue of differentiating strategies, let us look at two commonly\\nused strategies that have very different logistics implications. Consider products\\nwith different logistics priorities, such as those in Table 1.1:\\n●Cost: a high volume product for which demand is relatively stable throughout\\nthe year. While subject to occasional enhancements, these are usually small\\nscale: the life cycle is comparatively long. Demand forecasts are usually pretty\\naccurate.\\n●Time: a high variety product, which is designed for a given season and which\\nis completely redesigned for the next season. Often, it is impossible to predict\\nwhich colour or style will sell best. The product life cycle is short, and demand\\nis much more difﬁcult to forecast.\\nCost and time have quite different logistics implications. The very actions that\\nhelp to reduce costs, such as Far East sourcing, are completely the wrong strategy\\nwhen speed and responsiveness are top of the agenda. Similarly, investing in high\\nvolume, low variety equipment in the factory may create efﬁciency and low cost,\\nbut limit a ﬁrm’s ability to offer variety and fast response times. Developing the\\ncapability to support more of one priority (cost) hobbles the capability to support\\nanother (time). This is the principle of trade-off in logistics: more of one thing\\nmeans less of another. Ideally, we want two separate supply chains, one focused\\non cost, the other on time. This may not be fully practical because of the need to\\nmaintain a single European distribution centre. But logistics operations within\\nthe DC may well be kept separate to avoid one product line interfering with the\\nﬂow of the other. The same thinking may also apply within a given product range,\\nwhen everyday (‘base’) demand may need to be kept separate from promotional\\n(‘surge’) demand. We return to these concepts in the next chapter.\\nLogistics strategy\\n29'),\n",

Demand\\ninformation from the end-customer ﬂows in the opposite direction. A focal\\nﬁrm is positioned within a supply ‘network’, with tier 1 suppliers and tier 1\\ncustomers its immediate neighbours. Material ﬂow measures the quantity of\\nmaterial that passes through a given network per unit of time.\\n●A supply network is a system in which each organisation is linked to the\\nothers. Therefore the overall performance of the network results from the com-\\nbined performance of the individual partners.\\n●Logistics supports competitiveness of the supply chain as a whole by meeting\\nend-customer demand through supplying what is needed when it is needed at\\nlow cost.\\nWhat are the performance objectives of the supply chain, and how does logistics\\nsupport those objectives?\\n●‘Hard objectives’ are quality, speed and cost because they are easy to measure\\nand relatively obvious to the end-customer. Brieﬂy, quality is about doing\\nthings right, speed is about doing things fast, and cost is about doing things\\ncheaply. Supporting capabilities are concerned with controlling variability (the\\ndependability advantage), and dealing with uncertainty (the rapid response\\nadvantage). Uncertainty can be addressed by ﬂexibility in logistics processes –\\neither proactively or reactively. ‘Soft objectives’ are service-oriented, such as\\nsecurity and conﬁdence. They are less easily measurable than hard objectives.\\n●Such performance objectives can, and often are, augmented by other objectives\\nthatareoutsidelogistics.Theseincludeproductsuperiority,innovationandbrand.\\nHerethelogisticstaskistosupportsuchperformanceobjectivesinthemarketplace.\\n●The relative importance of logistics performance objectives varies from one\\nsituation to another.

In traditional\\nlocation theory, for example, transport costs were optimised in relation to dis-\\ntance to market and production locations. The origins of internationalisation can\\nbe traced back to the expanding trade routes of early civilisations. Discoveries\\nmade in excavations from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas reveal artefacts\\nmade hundreds or even thousands of miles away from the site, at the edges of\\ntheir respective known worlds. Developments in transport, navigation and com-\\nmunication have progressively expanded horizons. Measured in transport time\\nand costs the world has shrunk to the dimensions of a ‘global village’. Many take\\nfor granted the availability of products from around the world and safe, fast inter-\\ncontinental travel on container carriers and aircraft. It is in this context that a\\nclear link exists between logistics and economic development. The connectivity\\nof all regions of the world is essential for international trade. As a result, many\\nprojects aimed at supporting regional economic development focus on the infra-\\nstructure needed to support integration into the global economy. Much of the\\ninfrastructure to support international trade and business is founded on logistics\\noperations.\\nThe logistics dimension of internationalisation conjures up a vision of parts\\nﬂowing seamlessly from suppliers to customers located anywhere in the world,\\nand a supply network that truly spans the entire globe.

In assessing the nature of\\ncross-border interfaces in logistics, three questions can be asked:\\n●Does internationalisation imply a universal global approach of the supply\\nchain?\\n●Does internationalisation require a ‘global’ presence in every market?\\n●Does internationalisation distinguish between the companies that globally\\ntransfer knowledge and those that do not?\\nThe arguments presented in this section suggest that the answer to each of these\\nquestions is ‘no’.\\nThe ‘single business’ concept of structuring the supply chain in the form of\\nuniform approaches in each country is losing ground. ‘McColonisation’ was\\neffectively abolished when McDonald’s announced localisation of its business in\\nsuch areas as marketing and local relations. In response to local crises in quality,\\nand suffering from local competition, the corporate headquarters were down-\\nsized to help empower the local organisation. The same applies to the Coca-Cola\\nCompany, which has abandoned ‘CocaColonisation’ – based on a universal prod-\\nuct, marketing, and production and distribution model – for the same reasons. In\\nfavour of local brands and product varieties, Procter & Gamble is doing the same.\\nIn supply chains we ﬁnd regional variations in the application of international\\nprinciples.\\nThis does not mean to say that localisation is the new mainstay. Unilever, a tra-\\nditionally localised competitor of Procter & Gamble, has announced a decrease\\nin the number of brands, and has rationalised operations away from strict local-\\nisation over the past decade, and probably will continue to do so for a while.\\nDrivers and logistics implications of internationalisation\\n101'),\n",

Such\\nshifts of course have an impact on international trade and the ﬂow of goods. In\\nparticular, destinations change as well as logistics requirements. The ‘fourth gen-\\neration’ recognises the logistics trade-off between responsiveness to local markets\\nand internationalisation.\\nAt a company level, generic drivers of internationalisation include:\\n●a search for low factor and supply costs (land, labour, materials);\\n●the need to follow customers internationally in order to be able to supply\\nlocally and fast;\\n●a search for new geographical market areas;\\n●a search for new learning opportunities and exposure to knowledge (such as by\\nlocating in Silicon Valley – a ‘hot spot’ in development of international elec-\\ntronics, software and Internet industries).\\nThe importance of these drivers varies by company and with time. Considering\\nthe sequence of global shifts, proximity to production factors such as labour and\\nlow material costs can be considered more basic than market- or even knowledge-\\nrelated drivers. Furthermore, the importance of the respective drivers is depend-\\nent upon the internationalisation strategy of the company involved.

This allows them to\\nplace large orders for the whole group, which enables them to minimise costs by\\nusing their bargaining power and seeking economies of scale. At its extreme, a\\ncompany may source all of its requirements from its range of a given commod-\\nity, such as a raw material or component, from a single source.\\nInternationally operating companies are on a constant quest to ﬁnd new,\\ncheaper sources of labour and materials.

It also had a ripple effect\\non global trade overall. For example, return shipments were delayed because no\\nships were leaving the ports either. In addition, with so many ships and con-\\ntainers tied up other routes could not be served.

Rather than have a large number of local\\ndistribution centres, bringing these together at a small number of locations can\\nsave cost. Savings can be achieved in this way by coordinating inventory man-\\nagement across the supply pipeline. This allows duplication to be eliminated and\\nsafety stocks to be minimised, thereby lowering logistics costs and overall distri-\\nbution cycle times. Both may sound contrary to the fact that the transport\\npipeline will extend, owing to the longer distribution legs to customers from the\\ncentral warehouse in comparison with a local warehouse. Nevertheless, through\\ncentralising inventory major savings can be achieved by lowering overall specu-\\nlative inventories, very often coupled with the ability to balance peaks in\\ndemand across regional markets from one central inventory. Figure 4.5 charac-\\nterises the different operating environments where centralised inventory may be\\na more relevant or a less relevant consideration, based upon logistics character-\\nistics.\\nIn product environments where inventory costs are more important than the\\ndistribution costs, centralised inventories are a relevant concern. This is typically\\nthe case for products of high value (measured in costs per volume unit).\\nMicrochips are an extreme example: these products are of such high cost per\\nvolume unit that distributing from the moon could still be proﬁtable!\\nDistribution costs have a marginal impact on logistics costs per product, assum-\\ning of course that transport costs are mainly a function of volume and weight.\\nProducts that require special transport, such as antiques, art, conﬁdential docu-\\nments or dangerous chemicals, may represent a different operating environment.\\nA second dimension that needs to be taken into consideration is that of distri-\\nbution lead times. Here, we focus on physical distribution from warehouse to cus-\\ntomer, and not on the inbound pipeline. Centralising inventory may lead to\\nlower factory-to-warehouse distribution costs because shipments can be consoli-\\ndated into full container loads.

This buffers the factory, allowing it to respond to the local\\nvariations required in the different markets.\\n4.3.2 Extended and unreliable transit times\\nOwing to the length and increased uncertainty of international logistics\\npipelines, both planned and unplanned inventories may be higher than optimal.\\nA comparison of the length of domestic and international product pipelines and\\ntheir associated inventories is shown in Figure 4.7.

For example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) operates a globally\\nconsistent and coordinated structure of product ﬁnalisation and distribution in\\ncontrast to its continental operations. The company runs a ﬁnal manufacturing\\nand central distribution operation in Europe, the United States and Asia for each\\ncontinent. The operations are structured and run exactly the same, with the only\\ndifference being the regions and customers. Furthermore, including tiers of\\nplayers in the supply chain, these operations are largely outsourced. Facilities are\\noften owned and operated on a dedicated basis by a contract manufacturer and\\nthird parties. Hewlett-Packard only brings in some management to assure global\\ncoordination. Thus, although HP operates in a globalised way, its products are\\ntuned to local markets by means of local logistics operations. Therefore develop-\\nments in ICT do not eliminate the need for such local operations.\\nAnother example can be found in the automotive industry. In this industry,\\nmajor original equipment manufactuers (OEMs) structure their plant networks\\nglobally, while making suppliers build their plants in the immediate vicinity of\\nthe OEM plant. The distance or broadcasting horizon between the two plants is\\ndeﬁned by the time between the electronic ordering of a speciﬁcally ﬁnalised\\nsingle module on the on-line system and the expected time of delivery in\\nsequence along the assembly line. Time horizons for order preparation, ﬁnalisa-\\ntion, shipment and delivery tend to be in the area of an hour and a half or less.\\nThis causes localisation of the supplier or co-location, while the OEM plant serv-\\nices a continental or even global market.\\n4.4.2 The evolving role of individual plants\\nFerdows (1989) projects the theories by Bartlett and Ghoshal (1989) onto the role\\nof individual plants/factories in achieving the targeted international capabilities\\nof global efﬁciency, local responsiveness and worldwide learning, or a combi-\\nnation of the three. Using the same type of approach, with location consider-\\nations on the horizontal axis and performed activities on the vertical axis, van\\nHoek (1998) adjusted the model for distribution centres. The model indicates the\\nway in which the growth of performed activities changes the demands placed on\\nthe capabilities of the plant and changes the location requirements. Location is\\nconcerned with the response of governments to globalisation: adjusting local\\ntaxes, incentives and infrastructure to favour selection of their territory.\\nIn Figure 4.10 a traditional warehouse is projected to possibly develop into a semi-\\nmanufacturing operation with product ﬁnalisation among its responsibilities and\\nadded value. This also contributes to the creation of a ﬂexible facility for respond-\\ning to local markets. The model also indicates a possible downgrading of the plant,\\nwith its two-way arrows showing development paths. These developments could be\\ndriven by poor location conditions, an inability to reach supply chain objectives, or\\nthe ability to reach the supply chain objectives more easily at other plants in the\\ncompany’s network.

Cost in global supply chains: lessons from the\\napparel industry\\nVertical integration v. outsourcing\\nThe enormous success of vertical retailers like H&M, Zara, Gap and Next in the apparel\\nindustry in the last 10 years has forced manufacturers of brand labels like Esprit and\\nLevi, and department stores like El Corte Ingles and Marks & Spencer, to speed up their\\nsupply chains. Partly, this has been achieved by integrating their processes and systems\\nupstream (towards their suppliers) and downstream (towards their end-customers) in\\nthe supply chain.\\nThe competitive environment in the apparel industry is increasingly tough. Retail\\nprices are under pressure; competition is extending from products that were tradition-\\nally limited to upper, middle or lower segments of the market – and increasingly from\\nthe sports industry; gross margins are shrinking; retail store costs and personnel costs\\nare going up. Those who do not manage their assortment planning and inventories\\nwell are continuously under pressure to mark down their merchandise. Vertical retailers\\nhave found an answer to this hostile environment by: \\n●\\nincreasing the probability of designing a bestseller product by dramatically shorten-\\ning its time to market (see Chapter 5); \\n●\\npiloting products in the stores and then replenishing the best-sellers within 14 days\\nby new types of make-to-order processes; \\n●\\ndriving the inventory sales productivity (as measured by stock turn, sales per square\\nmetre and markdown percentage) by keen assortment and delivery planning;\\n●\\nintegrating the IT systems from point of sale back into garment production factories\\nand from there towards fabric suppliers;\\n●\\nfocusing on quality of workmanship through ﬁtting and process quality.\\nBrand label manufacturers traditionally do not own their retail stores, and department\\nstores do not have their own factories. This easily leads to competitive disadvantage in\\ncomparison with the vertical retailers, who have their own retail stores and have tight\\ncontrol over their manufacturers. To survive in today’s marketplace against the vertical\\nretailers, brand labels and department stores need to integrate their processes and sys-\\ntems from point of sale back into the factory. How can this be done?\\nCore competencies and time-to-market\\nCompanies like Esprit have initiated strategies to become vertical retailers themselves.\\nElements of this strategy are to focus on core competencies and to ofﬂoad all non-core\\nactivities to specialists who can perform such activities better and at a lower price.\\nAnother element of the strategy is to increase the number of collections from 4 to\\nbetween 6 and 12 per year. This enables them to be closer to the market and thus to fore-\\ncast and fulﬁl product demand more accurately. Of course, closeness to market increases\\nthe pressure on faster, timely product development and product delivery. The product life\\ncycles of the individual collections are shorter, which leads to enhanced requirements for\\nresponsiveness on all supply chain partners. There can be no buffers, and deliveries have\\nto be on time and in full. As a result of this, each partner in the chain has increased needs\\nCASE STUDY\\n4.4'),\n",

Worst\\npractice in CSR is for companies to publish a CSR report and to engage in PR\\nefforts to make the company look responsible, yet hide behind the approach:\\nI can’t see everything in my supply chain that happens on the other side of the\\nglobe in another company, so I can’t manage that. \\nSo not much changes in day-to-day operations – other than telling suppliers that\\nthey ‘need to be responsible for their actions’. \\n132\\nChapter 4 • Managing logistics internationally'),\n",

Return on investment (ROI) is measured as proﬁt (in €) before interest and\\ntax as a percentage of capital employed (also in €):\\n% ROI \\x02 100 \\x03 € Proﬁt / € Capital employed\\nThe term ‘investment’ is used because capital employed is equivalent to the\\nmoney invested in the business. ROI can also be seen as the outcome of prof-\\nitability and asset utilisation:\\n% ROI \\x02 100 \\n\\x03\\nLet us look at the detail behind each of these ratios, and the way they ﬁt in with\\neach other. Figure 3.1 gives a family tree of the way return on investment is made\\nup. Let us look at the potential for improving each from a point of view of man-\\naging the supply chain better.\\nSales\\nSuperior customer service improves sales, and makes our company more valued\\nby the customer in the long term.\\n●Improving customer responsiveness is a key goal for managing the supply chain.\\nCosts\\nThe supply chain is a potential gold mine for making bottom line improvements\\nto business performance. But directors of many businesses are impatient for cost\\nimprovement, and consider that cutting stocks and headcount is all that is\\nneeded. This may achieve short-term margin improvement, but strategic supply\\nchain management is about improving the way things are done and hence\\nimproving long-term performance.\\n●Supply chain modelling shows that manufacturing and distribution costs\\ntogether with inventories can be optimised while customer service is maximised.\\n●Studies in efﬁcient consumer response (ECR) have shown that cutting out non-\\nvalue-added products and inefﬁcient promotional activity can reduce overall\\ncosts by 6 per cent.

The costs of such items as materials used, power and wages all lead to bills\\nthat have to be paid. What is not so clear is how these costs should be allocated\\nto supply chain processes – or even to products for that matter. Christopher\\n(2005) states that problems with traditional cost accounting as related to logistics\\ninclude:\\n●the true costs of servicing different customer types, channels and market seg-\\nments are poorly understood;\\n●costs are captured at too high a level of aggregation;\\n●costing is functionally oriented at the expense of output;\\n●the emphasis on full cost allocation to products ignores customer costs.\\nThis section reviews commonly used ways of representing costs (ﬁxed and vari-\\nable, direct and indirect), and one less commonly used way (engineered and dis-\\ncretionary). If you are already familiar with the concepts of variable and ﬁxed\\ncosts and break-even charts, then start at section 3.3. Bear in mind that the total\\ncost picture is always the same; the different ways of representing them are\\nsimply different ways of ‘cutting the cake’. Let us look at the total cost as a cube\\ninstead of a cake. Then the three different ways of representing costs can be\\nshown as different ways of cutting up the cube (Figure 3.2).\\nThe important point here is that the total cost is constant: it is the ways\\nwe analyse that cost that are different. Why analyse it in different ways? To\\ngain better information about our cost basis so that we can manage the busi-\\nness better.

Two further categories\\nemerge:\\n●Direct costs can be tied to speciﬁc products. The most obvious examples are\\ndirect labour and direct materials. Thus we can allocate exactly the cost of\\nbought-in parts to the products into which they are built.\\n●Indirect costs are whatever is left over after direct costs have been allocated.\\nIndirect costs are also called ‘overheads’, and include everything from the\\nmanaging director’s salary to the rent rates paid for the distribution centre –\\nanything that cannot be allocated directly to a given product.\\nDirectness of costs is concerned with the extent to which costs can be allocated\\ndirectly to given products. This is a completely different concept from that of\\nﬁxed/variable costs. While there is a tendency to associate ﬁxed costs with indi-\\nrect and variable with direct, there is no necessary relationship at all. Thus direct\\nlabour costs tend to be ﬁxed, at least in the short term.\\nAs stated above, the reason for analysing costs differently is to gain better infor-\\nmation about our cost basis so that we can manage the business better. Direct and\\nindirect costs help us to decide the full cost of a product or service when more\\nthan one is offered. If there were just a single product, life would be easy, because\\nall of the costs could be allocated to that one product. Most businesses are much\\nmore complex than that, and are faced with the issue of how indirect costs\\nshould be apportioned to products. The most popular way to spread indirect\\ncosts is on the basis of direct labour. This is not the ‘correct way’, nor is it the\\nonly way.\\nOne way in which to get a closer view of how ﬁxed costs behave by product is\\nto use a method called direct product proﬁtability (DPP). This method has been\\nwidely used in the retail industry to understand the way in which logistics costs\\nbehave for each product. The understanding is achieved by allocating ﬁxed costs\\nby making assumptions about how these are incurred by a product as it moves\\nthrough the logistics system.\\nA good DPP system should take account of all the signiﬁcant differences in the\\nways products are developed, sourced, produced, sold and distributed.

A classic\\nexample of converting discretionary costs into engineered costs has been the\\nconversion of ‘quality’ as a discretionary concept into engineered ‘quality costs’\\n(Dale and Plunkett, 1995). This was achieved by breaking down the concept of\\nquality into three cost drivers:\\n●Prevention. This comprises the costs of measures to prevent defects from taking\\nplace, such as training and process capability studies.\\n●Appraisal. This comprises the costs incurred in detecting defects, which would\\ninclude testing and inspection.\\n●Internal and external failure. Internal costs are scrap, rework and the associated\\ncosts of not getting it right the ﬁrst time. External failure costs are rectiﬁcation\\nafter products have reached the ﬁnal customer, such as warranty claims,\\nreturns and repairs.\\nIn this case, it was argued, greater investment in prevention would result in the\\noverall cost of quality being reduced over time.\\nThe principle is to convert discretionary costs into engineered costs where\\npossible. As indicated in the above examples, it is usually possible to make an\\nestimate of what the engineered costs are, perhaps accompanied by a sensitivity\\nor risk analysis. Without such guidelines, decisions would have to be taken on\\n‘gut feel’ – or, as usually happens, not taken at all! In other words, the logistics\\nteam may have an excellent project for increased ﬂexibility in the distribution\\ncentre, but because they have not quantiﬁed the savings (outputs) the appli-\\ncation for funding is rejected.\\nHow can logistics costs be represented?\\n79\\nGlup SA\\nGlup SA supplies a range of household soaps to supermarkets in northern Europe.\\nThere are 12 stock-keeping units (skus) in the range.

If the prod-\\nuct is not available on the shelf, then it will lose sales to competitive products that are\\navailable, such as supermarket own brands. (Availability is a classic ‘order losing sensi-\\ntive’ qualifying criterion as described in section 1.3, Chapter 1.) Current available data\\nat Glup are scant, but suggest that average in-store availability is as low as 85 per cent\\nfor a given stock-keeping unit (sku). In order to convert this discretionary beneﬁt into an\\nengineered cost, Glup intends to measure the time for which each of the 12 product\\nlines is unavailable each week. One way to do this is to use a market research agency to\\nconduct sample studies of product availability in selected stores at random times across\\nthe working week. This will yield an availability guide, such as the 85 per cent ﬁgure\\nreferred to. The new system will, it is believed, reduce this unavailable time. Glup then\\nplans to model the new material-handling equipment methods using simulation, and to\\ncalculate the new in-store availability. The reduced non-availability time could then be\\nconverted into additional contribution for each sku to give an engineered cost saving.\\nReduced transportation costs\\nThe new equipment would also allow lower transportation costs, because trays of dif-\\nferent skus could be mixed together on the same pallet. Glup again intends to use simu-\\nlation modelling to identify the opportunities for savings using this method. It is\\nconsidered that this will offer the opportunity to reduce overall transport costs by more\\nﬂexible loading of the trailers used to distribute the products to Glup’s customers.\\nPromotions and new product launches\\nIt is considered that the new equipment will enable promotions and new product\\nlaunches to be delivered to selected stores more accurately and more quickly. Demand\\nuncertainty in such situations is very high: for example, a recent ‘three for the price of\\ntwo’ promotion created a ﬁvefold increase in sales. In order to launch a new product it\\nis ﬁrst necessary to drain the pipeline of the old product, or to ‘write it off’ as obsolete\\nstock. If the more ﬂexible warehouse system can reduce the length of the pipeline from\\nfactory to supermarket, it is argued, then a real saving in time or obsolete stock is poss-\\nible. Glup again intends to measure this by simulation. It will then be necessary to deter-\\nmine by how much sales will increase as a result of the new product advantages. This will\\nbe estimated by Glup marketing people, who will use experience of previous promotions\\nand new product launches. The engineered cost will be the additional time for which the\\nnew product is available multiplied by the additional estimated sales volume multiplied\\nby the contribution per unit. Alternatively, it will be the reduction in obsolete stocks mul-\\ntiplied by the total cost per product plus any costs of double handling and scrapping.\\nQuestion\\n1 Comment on Glup’s plans to create engineered costs from the perceived beneﬁts of\\nthe new material-handling equipment.'),\n",

How can costs be allocated to processes so that better\\ndecisions can be made?\\nThe driving force behind activity-based costing (ABC) is that the traditional way\\nof allocating indirect costs by spreading them to products on the basis of direct\\nlabour is becoming difﬁcult to manage. While direct labour used to constitute a\\nsubstantial portion of product costs, today that rarely applies. Therefore over-\\nhead rates of 500 per cent on direct labour are not uncommon. Just a small\\nchange in direct labour content would lead to a massive change in product cost.\\nCooper and Kaplan (1988) explain the problem by referring to two factories,\\nwhich we here refer to as Simple and Complex. Both factories produce 1 million\\nballpoint pens each year; they are the same size and have the same capital equip-\\nment. But while Simple produces only blue pens, Complex produces hundreds of\\ncolour and style variations in volumes that range from 500 (lavender) to 100,000\\n(blue) units per year. A visitor would notice many differences between the fac-\\ntories. Complex has far more production support staff to handle the numerous\\nproduction loading and scheduling challenges, changeovers between colours and\\nstyles, and so on. Complex would also have more design change issues, supplier\\nscheduling problems, and outbound warehousing, picking and distribution chal-\\nlenges. There would be much higher levels of idle time, overtime, inventory,\\nrework and scrap because of the difﬁculty of balancing production and demand\\nacross a much wider product range. Because overheads are allocated on the basis\\nof direct labour, blue pens are clobbered with 10 per cent of the much higher\\nComplex overheads. The market price of blue pens is determined by focused fac-\\ntories such as Simple, so the blue pens from Complex appear to be unproﬁtable.\\nAs a result, the management of Complex considers that specialist products such\\nas lavender – which sell at a premium – are the future of the business, and that\\nblue pens are low priority. This strategy further increases overheads and costs,\\nand perpetuates the myth that the unit cost of each pen is the same. Traditional\\ncost systems often understate proﬁts on high-volume products and overstate\\nproﬁts on low-volume, high-variety products. ABC principles would help the\\nmanagement of Complex to make more informed product decisions. The man-\\nagement of Simple has no need for another costing system; the current one works\\nwell for them.\\nABC recognises that overhead costs do not just happen, but are caused by\\nactivities, such as holding products in store. ABC therefore seeks to break the\\nbusiness down into major processes – such as manufacture, storage and distri-\\nbution – and then break each process into activities. For example, the distri-\\nbution process would include such activities as picking, loading, transport and\\ndelivery. For each of these activities, there must be one cost driver: what is it that\\ndrives cost for that activity? For example, the cost driver for the storage activity\\nmay be the volume of a case, whereas the transport activity may be driven by\\nweight. Once we know the cost driver, we need to know how many units of that\\ncost driver are incurred for that activity, and the cost per unit for the cost driver.\\nActivity-based costing (ABC)\\n81'),\n",

This yields the cost of the activity and, when summed across all of\\nthe activities in a process, the total cost of that process.\\nABC is difﬁcult to implement because we need ﬁrst to understand what the dis-\\ncrete processes are in a business where the existing links between functions are\\nnot well understood. There is then the issue of identifying the cost driver, which\\nrequires a fresh way of looking at each activity. For example, the cost driver for a\\nwarehouse fork-lift operator would be the number of pallets moved. The cost\\ndriver for stocking shelves would be the number of pieces that must be stacked\\nin a given time period. A further problem occurs if there is more than one cost\\ndriver for a given activity. You are then faced with the same problem as with over-\\nhead allocation: on what basis should the cost drivers be weighted? Usually, this\\nproblem shows that activities have not been broken down into sufﬁcient detail,\\nand that more analysis is needed. ABC can therefore become complex to imple-\\nment.\\nIn spite of the implementation challenges, logistics and ABC go hand in hand\\n(van Damme and van der Zon, 1999). It is a very rational way to analyse costs,\\nand logistics practitioners recognise that providing a service is about managing a\\nsequence of activities. Logistics or supply chain managers are particularly well\\nplaced to understand, analyse and apply ABC. They understand business pro-\\ncesses and the activities that go with them. Theirs is a cross-functional task. The\\nvalue chain stares them in the face.\\nThe procedure of determining cost drivers is often considered to be more valu-\\nable than the ABC system itself. Activity-based management enables the cost\\nstructure of a business to be examined in a new light, allowing anomalies to be\\nresolved and sources of waste highlighted. It may also help in better targeting\\ninvestment decisions.\\n3.3.1 ABC example\\nKomplex GmBH has four production lines, which each operates for 8,000 hours a\\nyear.Eachlinemakesanumberofproducts,whicharebasedonsizeandcolour.Many\\nchangeovers are therefore required, each incurring set-up and maintenance costs.\\nTraditionally the maintenance costs have been allocated on the basis of machine\\nhours, so each production line is charged equally. This year, the maintenance budget\\nof €1 million has been divided into four, so each line is charged with €250,000.\\nSales and marketing are concerned that certain products are losing market\\nshare, and this is due to prices relative to the competition. All departments have\\nbeen instructed to investigate costs and to suggest improvements. How can\\nactivity-based costing improve this situation? By identifying the cost driver for\\nmaintenance, in this case the number of changeovers, costs can be allocated to\\neach production line on this basis. Costs are then matched to the activity that\\ngenerates them, so avoiding cross-subsidies.\\nThe results are illustrated in Table 3.4.

The synergies of the two can then\\nprovide opportunities for identifying activities which create either value or waste.\\nThe cost–time proﬁle (CTP) (Bicheno, 2004) is a graph, which plots cumulative\\ntime against cumulative cost for a set of discrete activities that together form a\\nprocess or a supply chain. The CTP utilises outputs from two sources:\\n●activity times: from the time-based process mapping (TBPM) process time\\nrecording system (see Chapter 5);\\n●activity costs: from a process costing system that is underpinned by activity-\\nbased costing.\\nAs discussed earlier, ABC strives to achieve an equitable distribution of overhead\\ncosts to activities. Table 3.5 illustrates cumulative time and cost for a process\\ncomprising six activities.\\nTable 3.5\\nCumulative time and cost data by activity\\nActivity\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\nF\\nCumulative time (%)\\n14\\n64\\n65\\n67\\n97\\n100\\nCumulative cost (%)\\n25\\n45\\n83\\n85\\n95\\n100\\nSuch data can be used to construct a cost–time proﬁle. Bernon et al. (2003)\\nrecord the process in terms of time and cost for a poultry product from receipt\\nof live bird to delivery of ﬁnished product to the retailer. Overall, the process\\ntakes an average of 175 hours to complete. The proﬁle shows areas that consume\\ntime and cost within the supply chain, highlighting those for future investi-\\ngation that could yield savings. For example, distribution accounts for 35 per\\ncent of process time, but only 3 per cent of total cost. Slicing and packaging are\\nmore in line, since they account for 25 per cent of total cost and are responsible\\nfor 28 per cent of the total process time. Figure 3.8 shows the time–cost proﬁle\\nfor this process.'),\n",

Bicheno (2004)\\nstresses the importance of interpreting both the horizontal and vertical lines of\\nthe CTP:\\n●Long, horizontal lines tend to occur when there is a relatively small increase in\\ntotal cost as a result of an activity that runs over a relatively long period of\\ntime. An example is storage of ﬁnished product after slicing and packing.\\n●Steep, vertical lines tend to occur when costs are consumed over a relatively\\nshort period of processing time. An example is deboning, where the cumula-\\ntive cost rises sharply.\\nA focus on the long, horizontal sections of the CTP graph may help reduce cumu-\\nlative time (see Chapter 5). A focus on steep, vertical lines may help reduce cumu-\\nlative cost. The CTP can be used to prioritise improvement processes, as shown\\nin Figure 3.9:\\nProcesses in the top right-hand box are prime candidates for savings in both\\ntime and cost. Processes in the bottom left-hand box are low on the list of prior-\\nities. \\nA further conclusion of the Cranﬁeld study shown in Figure 3.8 was that\\ndecisions to optimise cost in one area could have a detrimental effect down-\\nstream (Whicker et al., 2006). Large batch sizes reduced the need for machine\\nchangeovers in manufacturing.

Kaplan and Norton (1996) point to the shortcomings of traditional cost\\naccounting systems. Traditional systems are geared to the needs of the stock market,\\nand are essentially historical and ﬁnancial in emphasis. Modern systems, they argue,\\nneed to be balanced between ﬁnancial and operations, and between history and the\\nfuture. A way of showing the relative emphasis between traditional measures and\\nbalanced measures is to show relative priorities by means of circles, where larger cir-\\ncles imply a greater priority and number of measures in use, as shown in Figure 3. 10.\\n86\\nChapter 3 • Value and logistics costs'),\n",

This covers the\\ncentre panel of logistics model: the ﬂow of materials, lead times and the network in\\na global context.\\nDespite its role in corporate success, the logistics task ultimately boils down to orches-\\ntrating the ﬂow of materials and information in the supply chain. The aim is to sup-\\nport products and services in the marketplace better than competitors. You could say\\nthat the logistics task is about making strategic objectives a reality by executing\\nagainst demand and making value propositions to customers a reality.\\nChapters 4 and 5 look at the basic dimensions of logistics operations: their inter-\\nnational reach and their contribution to a timely response to demand. Chapters 6 and\\n7 then take that thinking a level higher by introducing key managerial concepts that\\nsupport logistics operations. Chapter 6 addresses the immense amount of detail that\\nis needed to plan and control material ﬂow – both in the focal ﬁrm and more broadly\\nin the supply chain. We continue by considering the role of just-in-time and lean\\nthinking, which have become important ways of coordinating material movements in\\nan efﬁcient manner. The agile supply chain (Chapter 7) is a more recent concept that\\nfocuses on leveraging responsiveness to customer demand. Here, logistics plays a cru-\\ncial role in aligning material ﬂow across the supply network with customer demand,\\nand in ensuring execution in a ﬂexible and customised manner.\\nMaterial flow (supply) \\nInformation flow\\nTime \\nEnd-customer\\nEnd-customer\\nDownstream \\nUpstream \\nRaw material\\nRaw material\\nFocal firm'),\n",

We also saw how logistics contributes to competitive strat-\\negy and the performance objectives by which we can measure this contribution.\\nBut what is it that drives the need for ﬂow in the ﬁrst place? The key point to\\nrecognise here is that it is the behaviour of the end-customer that should dictate\\nwhat happens. As stated in Chapter 1, the end-customer starts the whole process\\nby buying ﬁnished products. It is this behaviour that causes materials to ﬂow\\nthrough the supply chain. Only end-customers should be free to make up their\\nminds about when they want to place an order on the network – after that, the\\nsystem takes over.\\nQuality of service addresses the process of handing over products and services\\ninto the hands of end-customers. Only after this process has been completed\\ndoes the product/service reach its full value. And the handover process offers\\nmany opportunities for adding value. Instead of picking up a product from a\\ndistributor who is remote from the focal firm, there are opportunities during\\nthe sales transaction (for example, help and advice in using the focal firm’s\\nproducts), as well after the sales transaction (for example, after sales service and\\nwarranty).\\nThe intended objectives of this chapter are to:\\n●develop the marketing perspective on supply chain management;\\n●explain how customer segmentation works, and to emphasise its\\nimportance to logistics;\\n●explain the connection between quality of service and customer loyalty;\\n●show how current segmentation practice can be re-engineered to set\\nlogistics priorities.\\nBy the end of this chapter you should be able to understand:\\n●how supply chains should compete by aligning logistics strategy with\\nmarketing strategy;\\n●how to use logistics strategy drivers to help redeﬁne segments to achieve\\nthis alignment.\\nObjectives'),\n",

Satisﬁed [end] customers are seen as the only\\nsource of proﬁt, growth and security.\\nMarketing in practice is a series of plans and decisions that determines how the\\nphilosophy will be actioned.\\n‘Satisﬁed customers’ are increasingly hard to ﬁnd. This has been caused by\\nwidespread changes that are affecting the world we live in. Two of the major\\nchanges are rising customer expectations and the information revolution (Doyle,\\n2000). We expand on these below. Sir Terry Leahy, Chief executive of Tesco plc,\\ntalks of harnessing customer power (2005):\\nThe basic assumption that customers choose – that they know best what they want\\n– means that they have become the centre of the retailer’s universe. In the best busi-\\nnesses, their decisions drive everything. These choices are also judgements. They pick\\nthe winners and losers in retail and in manufacturing. This is not theoretical: they\\nregularly pass verdicts, moving from product to product and store to store. These\\njudgements send strong feedback – shocks might be a better word – forcing change.\\nIn Chapter 1, we referred to ‘tier 1 customers’ with whom a focal ﬁrm deals\\ndirectly, and to ‘end-customers’ who are the individuals or businesses that buy\\nthe ﬁnished ‘product’ at the end of the supply network. It is therefore usual to\\nrefer to two types of customer:\\n●business customers: who represent the focal ﬁrm’s immediate trading environ-\\nment (see Figure 1.2)\\n●end-customers: who represent the ultimate customer for the network as a whole\\n(see Figure 1.4).\\n34\\nChapter 2 • Putting the end-customer ﬁrst'),\n",

In section 1.2.2 of Chapter 1, we referred to\\nthe need to integrate supply chain processes so that they are aligned towards end-\\ncustomer needs. In this sense, B2B integration should be aligned towards the ulti-\\nmate B2C process.\\nWe also need to distinguish here between customers and consumers. Webster\\n(2000) deﬁnes them thus:\\n●consumers are people who use or consume the product;\\n●customers are individuals or businesses who buy the product, meaning that\\nthey acquire it and pay for it.\\nIt is usual in business today to refer to ‘customers’ as the next process in a supply\\nchain. This includes ‘all types of marketing intermediaries or channel members\\nwho buy for resale to their customers’ (Webster, 2000).\\n2.1.1 Rising customer expectations\\nExpectations have risen among customers in line with a general increase in the\\nwealth of developed countries over the latter half of the twentieth century. This\\nincrease in expectations has many causes, including:\\n●better levels of general education;\\n●better ability to discern between alternative products;\\n●exposure to more lifestyle issues in the media.\\nThese expectations have led to customers not only aspiring to more desirable\\nproducts, they are also demanding much better levels of service to be associated\\nwith those products.\\nBusinesses are also expecting more from their suppliers. Suppliers need to pay\\nincreasing attention to the service aspects of their dealings with industrial cus-\\ntomers. This is especially true when the customer has implemented more cus-\\ntomer-centric management systems such as just-in-time (Chapter 6).\\n2.1.2 The information revolution\\nOf the many technological advances in recent years, the explosion in appli-\\ncations of Internet technology is having the most sweeping effects. Our study of\\nthe future impact of buyer–supplier Internet-enabled exchanges (Daniel et al.,\\n2003) highlighted three areas:\\n●Procurement, supply chain management and new product development. Exchanges\\nare helping to reduce cycle times and to remove errors and duplication.\\nSuppliers beneﬁt mostly from reduced transaction costs, enhanced marketing\\npresence and reduced errors.

Exchanges are increasing the level of trust between\\nbuyers and suppliers, which is key to good trading relationships. Rather than\\nleading to an increase in the number of suppliers used by buyers, e-hubs are\\nencouraging the continued trend of supplier rationalisation – resulting in\\nlonger-term relationships with remaining suppliers. The increased ability to\\nshare information between buyers and suppliers made possible by the use of e-\\nhubs will result in increased joint problem solving. This will accelerate the\\ntrend of supplier-led innovation and increased outsourcing to suppliers.\\n●Impact on industry structure. Exchanges are contributing to the trend of reduc-\\ning the number of manufacturers and suppliers in most sectors. Exchanges\\nencourage the use of open book accounting, and reduce the traditional mark-\\nups associated with multi-tier supply chains. They support the trend of tier 1\\nsuppliers acting as service providers and directing a network of subsuppliers.\\nFaced with rising customer expectations and the information revolution, supply\\nchain partners are increasingly asking how they can act together to meet these\\nchallenges. The starting point is to analyse needs and wants in order to satisfy a\\nsupply chain’s end-customers. The marketing perspective has a well-known way\\nto help in this analysis – segmentation.\\n2.2 Segmentation\\nKey issue: What is segmentation, and what are its implications to logistics strat-\\negy?\\nSegmentation describes how a given market might be broken up into different\\ngroups of customers with similar needs. It means ‘describing the market as simply\\nas possible while doing our best to emphasise its variety’ (Millier and Palmer,\\n2000). We start by considering market segmentation from a customer perspective\\nin what are usually described as ‘fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)’ markets.\\nFor example, segmentation of the market for suntan creams and lotions would\\nbegin with an understanding of:\\n●the beneﬁts wanted (e.g. water resistance, oil/non-oil, sun factor);\\n●the price consumers are prepared to pay;\\n●the media to which they are exposed (television programmes, magazines, etc.);\\n●the amount and timing of their purchases.\\nProﬁles of the segments and evaluation of their relative attractiveness to the focal\\nﬁrm can then be developed.\\nThere are many possible ways in which markets can be segmented, including:\\n●demographic: such as age, sex and education;\\n●geographic: such as urban v. country, type of house and region;\\n36\\nChapter 2 • Putting the end-customer ﬁrst'),\n",

It is vital that the deﬁnition of\\nsegments is not a marketing-only task, but that logistics is involved. The key\\npoint is that there is no point in deﬁning segments that cannot be served because\\nlogistics capability does not exist. For example, if most of the spending pattern is\\naround Christmas, then logistics must be capable of supporting the huge surge in\\ndemand at that time. Case study 2.1 explains how a retailer views its behavioural\\nsegments.\\nSegmentation\\n37\\nManaging events and promotions in the retail sector\\nIf consumers only purchased their requirements in line with their use, then it would be\\nrelatively easy to reorganise the end-to-end supply chain from shelf to national ware-\\nhouse using lean principles (see Chapter 6). A simple demand–pull system replenishing\\ntomorrow that which has been sold today, direct to shelf, would streamline store oper-\\nations and reduce inventories signiﬁcantly. Retailers like Wal-Mart in the United States\\nand Tesco in Britain have pursued an everyday low price policy in an attempt to maxi-\\nmise this ‘steady state’ replenishment policy. However, in Europe, most retailers have\\nfound that customers enjoy promotions and that promotions boost sales. In any case,\\nevents like Christmas and back to school create huge surges in demand.\\nEvents may be divided in two: seasonal events and promotional events, as shown in\\nTable 2.1:\\nRetailers have no control over the timing of seasonal events and it is usually very dif-\\nﬁcult to forecast likely demand with normal levels of accuracy. In contrast, promotional\\nevents are planned by retailers and their suppliers. Consequently, while demand may\\nbe unpredictable, the timing of such events is known in advance. It is surprising, there-\\nfore, how often consumers will ﬁnd that items on promotion are not on the shelf and\\nthat display aids and promotional material will be missing. The event which has the\\ngreatest effect is Christmas – where sales usually start growing in October, ramp up in\\nNovember and peak in December. This is the only proﬁtable quarter for many retailers.\\nThe product is frequently sourced from the Far East and once the order has been deliv-\\nered there will be no further shipments. Retailers need to plan for this activity months\\nin advance and cross their ﬁngers that they will not miss sales through under-ordering\\nCASE STUDY\\n2.1\\nTable 2.1 Example seasonal events and promotions\\nSeasonal events\\nPromotions\\n●Valentine’s Day\\n●Three for two\\n●Mother’s Day\\n●Buy one get one free\\n●Summer holidays\\n●10% off for a week\\n●Back to school\\n●Happy hour – 20%\\n●Christmas\\n●Triple loyalty card points\\n●Gift with purchase'),\n",

The position is\\nfurther complicated in a national chain where demand patterns will be different store\\nby store and region by region.\\nMany retailers allocate their Christmas merchandise to individual stores on the basis\\nof previous year’s sales for the particular product category and hope for the best. A lean\\ndesign supply chain is unable to cope with such spiky demand, which will be affected\\nfurther by marketing efforts and the latest fad. Retailers therefore need to be particu-\\nlarly agile in their approach in order to satisfy unknown demand.\\nBoots The Chemists (BTC) – the leading UK health and beauty retailer – has\\napproached this problem by outsourcing speciﬁc Christmas merchandise deliveries.\\nThese deliveries are scheduled at different times of the day from ‘normal’ deliveries. In\\nthis way, while not dealing with the issues created by unpredictable demand, store\\noperations can apply appropriate resources to unload vehicles and put away directly to\\nshelf or indirectly to stockroom. Historically, promotional events in BTC were a fairly hit\\nand miss affair with hundreds of products being promoted within a four-week window.\\nThere was a high reliance on good luck for all the elements to come together prior to\\nthe start of the promotional period. Inevitably some products, display aids and show\\nmaterial arrived late. Store operations at the end of the supply chain then had to try\\nand mount the promotions with what had been delivered. Consumers were dissatisﬁed\\nwith the result and sales were lost.\\nThe solution was to create a dedicated promotions team within the categories. The\\nteam masterminded the overall promotional plan and were made responsible for the\\ndelivery of products, display aids and show materials into the national distribution cen-\\ntres (NDCs). A successful trial was then conducted whereby most of the work required\\nto mount the promotion was done by logistics staff in the regional distribution centres\\n(RDCs) for each of the individual stores.\\nThe trial comprised sending allocations of all the promotional requirements to the\\nRDCs from the NDCs. Staff in the RDCs then picked products for a week’s anticipated\\nsales (based on historical data for that line by individual store) into totes for direct-to-\\nshelf delivery together with appropriate display aids and show material. The totes were\\nthen placed on dollies, rolled on and off vehicles, and wheeled into the shop to the cor-\\nrect gondola end (end of free-standing ‘island’ shelf in a store). After three days, EPOS\\ndata was reviewed, and an accurate prediction of future sales to the end of the pro-\\nmotion was made. This was then used to calculate future replenishment requirements.\\nFinally the merchandising teams were invited to devise clever ways to make shelves look\\nfull at the end of the promotion without using a lot of stock. This resulted in fewer\\n‘remainders’ from a promotion that had to be written down. BTC is currently imple-\\nmenting its design for a transformed end-to-end supply chain and the work described\\nabove is being gradually rolled out.\\n(Source: Philip Matthews, formerly Supply Chain Director, BTC)\\nQuestions\\n1 List the logistics challenges of mounting promotions and events at a retailer such as\\nBTC.'),\n",

This meant the loss of\\nsome customers who had gone to Powerdrive because they could rely on the\\ncompany’s technical leadership to produce designs that suited their particular needs.\\nThis was not considered important because the combined sales volume of such cus-\\ntomers was under 5 per cent.\\nUsing the new designs, Tom was now able to reorganise the factory into cells that\\nproduced major subassemblies such as rotors and stators. The work ﬂow was trans-\\nformed, and manufacturing throughput time was reduced from six weeks to just four\\ndays. Cost improvements meant that average price reductions of between 10 and 15\\nper cent could be offered.\\nPowerdrive’s customer service policy was redrafted to offer quotations within a maxi-\\nmum of one hour of any enquiry, and for deliveries of ﬁnished product to be made\\nwithin one week ‘anywhere in northern Europe’. This new policy was explained to\\ninternal sales staff, and to sales representatives and agents employed by the organis-\\nation. If ‘old’ customers wanted special designs that were no longer in the range, the\\nsales staff were instructed to explain Powerdrive’s new policy and to politely decline the\\norder.\\nAt ﬁrst, business soared. Impressed by the lower prices and short delivery times, cus-\\ntomers ﬂocked to Powerdrive and sales jumped by 50 per cent. But then things began\\nto go sour. First, the factory could no longer cope with the demands being placed on\\nit. The addition of a large order for lawnmower motors blocked out a lot of production\\ncapacity from January to June. Order lead times during this period in particular slid back\\nto former levels. Second, a Brazilian supplier spotted the opportunity to enter the\\nmarket with prices that undercut Powerdrive by 20 per cent. While only half of the\\nproduct range was covered by this new entrant, it was the high volume products that\\nwere especially threatened. Further, the new competitor offered three-day lead times\\nfrom stock that had been established in Europe. Third, some of the former customers\\nwho could no longer obtain their bespoke designs from Powerdrive were complaining\\nwithin the industry that Powerdrive’s technical leadership had been sacriﬁced. Although\\nsmall in number, such customers were inﬂuential at trade fairs and conferences.\\nQuestions\\n1 Evaluate the changes that took place in the segmentation of Powerdrive’s market.\\n2 Characterise the changes using the concept of order winners and qualiﬁers.'),\n",

CleanCo currently segments its customers on the value of customer\\naccounts. The primary division is between national accounts, for which 10 accounts\\nconstitute 70 per cent of sales by value, and ﬁeld sales, which comprise a long ‘tail’ of\\nmore than 200 accounts that together make up only 30 per cent of sales. Due to the\\nsize of the ﬁeld sales structure, a secondary classiﬁcation groups accounts by channel\\ntype: neighbourhood retail, discount and pharmacy. CleanCo recognises the need to\\nreduce the long customer ‘tail’ and is introducing distributors for orders below a mini-\\nmum quantity. CleanCo’s current approach to segmentation is summarised in Table\\n2.3.\\nWhile CleanCo currently segments its retail customers by account size, its sales organ-\\nisation has identiﬁed two signiﬁcant types of buying behaviour displayed by the cus-\\ntomer base, shown in Table 2.4:\\n●\\nvolume-driven buying behaviour;\\n●\\nmargin-driven buying behaviour.\\nVolume-driven customers are keen to capitalise on both product and supply chain cost\\nsavings in order to pass them on to their customers to drive volume sales. There are two\\nvariants of the volume-driven behaviour:\\n●\\neveryday low price (EDLP);\\n●\\ndiscount.\\nRetailers pursuing an EDLP strategy strive for continuous price reduction from sup-\\npliers like CleanCo to drive a fairly consistent, high volume of sales. This should result\\nin a relatively stable pattern of demand in the washing and bathing sector. Discounters\\non the other hand are looking for bargains so they can ‘stack ‘em high and sell ‘em\\ncheap’, a strategy more likely to result in a volatile demand pattern. Margin-driven cus-\\ntomers are keen to add value for their customers by offering a wide selection of prod-\\nucts and value-adding services. This strategy also results in a relatively stable demand\\npattern in this sector.\\nCASE STUDY\\n2.3\\nTable 2.3\\nCleanCo – Current approach to market segmentation\\nNational accounts\\nField sales\\n70% sales\\n30% sales, 200+\\naccounts\\n10 accounts\\nNeighbourhood retail\\nDiscount sector\\nPharmacy\\nTable 2.4\\nCleanCo – potential for behavioural segmentation\\nVolume-driven\\nMargin-driven\\nEvery day low price (EDLP)\\nDiscount'),\n",

Such factors include product types (e.g. premium, mid, utilitarian), product\\nrange (e.g. current products, end of lines, ‘b’ grade), merchandising requirements (e.g.\\ncategory captains) and promotions strategy (e.g. roll-back, 12-week, 4-week, Hi-Lo).\\nPromotions are by far the most disruptive of these factors. Although the promotions are\\ngenerally planned well in advance with the retailers, they cause signiﬁcant disruption to\\nthe supply chain operations due to the peaks and troughs in demand that they create.\\nFurthermore, the deeper the promotional activity the greater the volatility created and\\nthe greater the disruption to the supply chain.

How does sat-\\nisfaction stack up with customer loyalty?\\nMost supply chains that involve physical products end with service processes such\\nas retailing (grocery or apparel), healthcare (pharmaceutical and other medical\\ngoods) and distribution (motor cars). Service processes mean that the customer is\\npresent in some way, although distribution through web-based shopping, tele-\\nphone and mail order mean that customers do not have to be physically present.\\nPerformance of service processes often differs between employees, between cus-\\ntomers and from one hour to the next. If you want good service from the local\\nsupermarket, do not go on Saturdays or near to Christmas when the service is\\nunder severe capacity pressure: on-shelf availability is at its lowest, and queues at\\nthe checkout are at their longest. The key point is that ‘service is the combination\\nof outcomes and experiences delivered to and received by the customer’\\n(Johnston and Clark, 2005).\\nQuality of service takes place during service delivery, which is the interaction\\nbetween the customer (B2B or B2C) and the service process. ‘Gaps’ can emerge\\nbetween what the service is supposed to be, what the customer expects it to be, and\\nhow the customer perceives it when it is delivered (Zeithaml et al., 1988, Parasuraman\\net al., 1991). We can illustrate these gaps as a simpliﬁed gap model (Figure 2.2):\\n●Gap 1 refers to differences between customer expectations and how these have\\nbeen developed into a service speciﬁcation by the supplier.\\n●Gap 2 refers to differences between how the speciﬁcation was drawn up and\\nhow it was delivered.\\n●Gap 3 refers to differences between what the customer expected and what s/he\\nperceived was delivered.\\n●Gap 4 refers to differences between how supplier and customer perceived the\\nservice delivery.\\nGaps in quality of service can arise, as seen in the IKEA case study.\\n44\\nChapter 2 • Putting the end-customer ﬁrst\\nSupplier\\nCustomer\\nGap 1\\nGap 4\\nGap 2\\nGap 3\\nService\\nspecification\\nExpected\\nservice\\nService\\ndelivery\\nPerceived\\nservice\\nFigure 2.2\\nSimpliﬁed service quality gap model\\n(Source: After Parasuraman et al., 1991)'),\n",

But the main store had lost her order, so she had to go to customer serv-\\nice.

It is a behaviour (do they buy from us more than once?).\\nNevertheless, the attitude of customer satisfaction is key to the behaviour of cus-\\ntomer loyalty. Parasuraman and Grewal (2000) link the two concepts by propos-\\ning the ‘key drivers of customer loyalty’, shown in Figure 2.3. Also, note the\\nconnection to Tesco’s core purpose on page 6.\\nThe beneﬁts of customer loyalty are potentially huge. The loyal customer\\nshould be viewed in terms of lifetime spending potential. Thus, a customer of\\nVW Audi Group could be viewed as worth €300k rather than the €30k of today’s\\nsales transaction. As Johnston and Clark (2005) put it, loyal customers:\\n●generate long-term revenue streams (high lifetime values);\\n●tend to buy more than new customers;\\n●tend to increase spending over time;\\n●may be willing to pay premium prices;\\n●provide cost savings compared with attracting new customers.\\nThe logistics challenge is to support the development of customer loyalty by\\ndesigning and delivering quality of service. Of the three drivers of customer loy-\\nalty shown in Figure 2.3, quality of service is ‘essential for excellent market per-\\nformance on an enduring basis’ (Berry, 1999: 8–9). The rationale for this is that\\n‘service quality is much more difﬁcult for competitors to copy than are product\\nquality and price’. Supporting product availability through such means as chan-\\nnel selection, market coverage, distribution systems and dealer support all help\\nto nourish customer loyalty. So does logistics support of product characteristics\\n(such as variety or product range) and of marketing initiatives (such as promo-\\ntions).\\n2.3.2 Value disciplines\\nFigure 2.3 refers to ‘perceived value’. A development of the service quality–\\nproduct quality–price model is that of value disciplines. Instead of competing on\\nall of these fronts equally, Treacy and Wiersema (1997) argue that companies\\ntaking leadership positions do so by narrowing their competitive focus, not by\\nbroadening it. They propose three strategies, or ‘generic value disciplines’ that\\ncan be followed:\\n●Operational excellence. Here, the strategy centres on superb operations and\\nexecution, often by providing a reasonable quality at low price. The focus is on\\nefﬁciency, streamlining operations, supply chain management, everyday low\\nprice. Most large international corporations use this discipline.\\n●Product leadership. Here, the leaders are very strong in innovation and brand\\nmarketing and operate in dynamic markets. The focus is on development, inno-\\nvation, design, time-to-market and high margins in a short timeframe. ‘It was\\nthe ability of Apple to innovate in many spaces – getting the music companies\\nto agree to 99 cent pricing, creating wonderful iTunes software, making a ter-\\n46\\nChapter 2 • Putting the end-customer ﬁrst'),\n",

Each had been\\nsignalled by advancing the concepts of what is meant by ‘quality of service’. Stage 1\\nhad been the basic product: a sealed lead-acid battery for use in mining applications.\\nBatteries were regarded by customers as a mature product and as a ‘grudge buy’. Each\\nyear, the basic product was under heavy downward price pressure. Stage 2 had been\\nthe industry reaction to customer service: the addition of warranty replacement of\\ndefective products, of quality assurance (QA) audits of a supplier’s design and manu-\\nfacturing processes, and of parts and service provision.\\nStage 3 had recognised the need to go much further in terms of customer service. A\\nwhole raft of additional services had been conceived with a view to adding value.\\nBreakdowns were ﬁxed at short notice by means of ﬁeld service engineers. Everglo\\nproducts could now be delivered and installed at customer premises. Price lists were\\nsimpliﬁed by including peripheral equipment, such as contactors, that had to be added\\nto a battery rack in order to make it work. Advice and tips were added to help cus-\\ntomers warm to Everglo products. In a proactive move, Everglo introduced charts and\\nadvice about the application of battery products in general, and the resulting tables\\nbecame an industry standard. Parts and service in the ﬁeld were upgraded to a ’24-\\nhour, no-nonsense back-up service’. And customer training built on Everglo’s position\\nas an industry leader. Rather than sales seminars, Everglo’s were customer training sem-\\ninars, where the company spoke on behalf of the industry rather than as a supplier.\\nIn spite of having reached a pre-eminent position in mining power supply, Everglo\\nrecognised that the centre of Figure 2.5 was in effect a ‘black hole’.

These can be used to monitor performance over\\ntime and to compare (‘benchmark’) the processes with others. Table 2.6 lists\\nexamples of service level measures used in retail supply chains (after Rafele,\\n2004).\\n2.4 Setting priorities for logistics strategy\\nKey issues: How can we segment our market to make it easier to supply? How can\\nwe use such knowledge to improve logistics strategy?\\nSetting priorities to assure quality of service leads to establishment of perform-\\nance measures. Priorities should be used to help ensure that:\\n●partners in a supply network focus on providing end-customer value;\\n●partners in that network can see how well the network as a whole is perform-\\ning against this yardstick.\\nIn this way they can judge whether performance is improving or declining, and\\nassess the effect on quality of service of changes to the system.\\nIn order to set priorities for quality of service, we begin by putting the end-\\ncustomer ﬁrst. The aim is to identify groups of end-customers whose needs can\\nbe serviced in focused, targeted ways. The needs deﬁne groups and give them an\\nidentity, as we explained in section 2.2 on segmentation. Because segments\\ntherefore have different characteristics, it is usually a mistake to take a ‘one size\\nﬁts all’ approach to servicing them. Our research has shown that the starting\\npoint for segmentation is often conceived by marketing in isolation, and does\\nnot make any sense in logistics terms (Godsell et al., 2006). Logistics is therefore\\nleft with an impossible task. Since logistics is actually part of the marketing mix\\n(see ‘place’ under section 2.2 above), ability to provide quality of service is off to\\na bad start!

We return to the concept of ‘value’ in\\nChapter 3. Meanwhile, we will continue to use the AutoCo example to illustrate\\nsteps 3 and 4.\\n2.4.4 Step 3: Measure logistics strategy drivers\\nHere, we examine demand proﬁle and competitive proﬁle as drivers of logistics\\nstrategy:\\n●Demand proﬁle. Usually, high volume products are associated with compara-\\ntively low variety (few skus) and low demand variability and uncertainty.\\nExamples are washing powders in retail, and volume cars like Ford and VW’s\\nbig sellers. Note that demand variability can be created by means of promo-\\ntions. Low volume, high variety products – such as most automotive spare\\nparts, and many health and beauty products – tend to have the opposite\\ndemand proﬁles. \\n●Competitive proﬁle. This is based on the competitive factors we introduced in\\nsection 1.3 – hard objectives (quality, time and cost), supporting capabilities\\n(controlling variability and dealing with uncertainty in logistics processes) and\\nsoft objectives (such as conﬁdence and security). For example, Ford chooses to\\ncompete on low price and delivery speed (by making to stock), while BMW\\nchooses to compete by making more expensive and highly speciﬁed cars to\\ncustomer order while the customer waits. While they also appear in the\\ndemand proﬁle as characteristics, we refer here to variability and uncertainty\\nin terms of a focal ﬁrm’s capability to cope with them better than the compe-\\ntition.\\nBoth of these proﬁles have profound implications for logistics strategy, some of\\nthe key implications for which are summarised in Figure 2.9.\\nFor example, the higher the demand variability and uncertainty, the greater\\nthe need for buffers. Buffers can be in the form of spare capacity, inventory and\\norder lead times. If we want to shorten the time the customer has to wait, then\\nit is necessary to make speculatively – perhaps ﬁnishing off (customising) the\\nproduct once the ﬁnal order details are known. Finally, planning and controlling\\nthe ﬂow of materials across the supply chain needs to be carried out centrally\\nwhen in high demand variability and uncertainty conditions in order to coordi-\\nnate the response of supply partners. In more stable demand conditions, it is\\npossible to relax controls and allow more local ﬂexibility.\\n2.4.5 Step 4: Specify future approach to market segmentation\\nUsing logistics strategy drivers it is now possible to revisit the customer value pro-\\nﬁles in Figure 2.8 and develop a fresh approach to segmentation that makes sense\\nin logistics terms. In Figure 2.10, we have analysed the two customers (A and B)\\nin Figure 2.8 in terms of their key demand and competitive proﬁles. Customers\\n54\\nChapter 2 • Putting the end-customer ﬁrst'),\n",

Segments need to be\\nmeasurable, economically viable, accessible and actionable. Marketing in prac-\\ntice continues by market positioning, which requires differential advantage to\\nbe deﬁned, and the marketing mix to be formulated.\\n●The key logistics contribution to the marketing mix is in the ‘fourth P’, place.\\nThis includes decisions about factors such as channel selection, market cover-\\nage, distribution systems and dealer support. Logistics also supports product\\ndecisions (for example, product range) and promotion activity.\\n●Supply networks end with service processes, where the end-customer is pres-\\nent in some way. ‘Gaps’ can emerge between what the service is supposed to\\nbe, what the customer expects it to be, and how the customer perceives it\\nwhen it is delivered. The size of these gaps has implications for quality of serv-\\nice, a major driver of customer loyalty.\\nHow do we win and retain customers through logistics?\\n●The principle here is that loyal customers have many advantages over new\\nones. The logistics challenge is to reinforce loyalty by exceeding customer\\nexpectations via superior quality of service.\\n●Customer relationship management is based on the principle that marketing\\nstrategies should be continuously extended to strengthen customer loyalty.\\nPhases of logistics development are needed, each phase placing increasing\\ndemands on the development of logistics capabilities.\\n●Setting logistics priorities should be carried out with market segments in mind.\\nThis is a joint task between marketing and logistics functions.

Further changes are affecting these\\nsuppliers as Global’s own customers continue to demand higher levels of service. If you\\nare unfamiliar with the term material requirements planning (MRP), it is explained in\\nChapter 6 (e.g. see page 175).\\nGlobal is one of Britain’s largest manufacturers of lighting products. The market for\\narchitectural lighting, one of its major product lines, has become increasingly volatile\\nand competitive in recent years. Pressure to supply products more cheaply and more\\nquickly to a higher standard on an international basis has meant that Global has had to\\nwork hard on shortening product life cycles and reducing delivery lead times.\\nDuring 1996, the new managing director raised the proﬁle of logistics by making an\\nappointment at board level. Following this change in organisational structure, a ‘lean’\\napproach to supply chain management and manufacturing was implemented over the\\nnext three years. But recently the lean approach to managing the supply chain has been\\nfound to have serious shortcomings in terms of meeting increased demand for cus-\\ntomised products such as architectural lighting. Consequently, Global’s supply chain\\nmanagement strategy has evolved to accommodate the rapid growth in the market for\\nthese products. This change resulted in a multifaceted supply chain strategy, which\\nincreases Global’s ability to meet the mass customisation needs of its customer base.\\nThis multiple strategy approach has created many challenges for suppliers.\\nPrior to 1996\\nBefore 1996 Global’s organisation and management of its internal and external supply\\nchains was based on a single, familiar approach. Global managed internal manufactur-\\ning operations and material ﬂow on a push principle driven by MRP.\\nThe supply base was managed through an essentially adversarial approach.

New suppliers would be assessed on\\nthe basis of price and component quality only, and no obligation of repeat purchase\\nwas expected if the supplier did not retain the lowest price. Price, not cost, was the\\nmain objective of the buying group.\\nAfter 1996\\nDuring 1996, the managing director and his changed board of directors developed a\\nnew strategy to manage internal and external operations. Manufacturing was restruc-\\ntured to improve customer service and to increase proﬁtability. Following an extensive\\nprogramme of data collection and analysis, the production facility was segmented into\\ntwo distinct sections. One section became a low-volume, irregular-demand factory\\nemploying operators with broad product knowledge. The other area became the high-\\nvolume, regular-demand factory, with focused and repetitive build tasks. These two\\nareas also operated their internal supply chains in distinctly different formats. The low-\\nvolume area continued with a push (MRP) strategy, while the high-volume section\\noperated a pull strategy using kanban, as shown in Table 2.7.\\nIn addition to restructuring the internal supply chain, the historical approach to man-\\naging the external chain of suppliers was altered. Because materials constituted more\\nthan 80 per cent of the cost of sales, the decision was made to acknowledge vendors\\nas an intrinsic part of the organisation. Improving the performance of the suppliers and\\nthe efﬁciency of the exchange between the ﬁrms was recognised as key to Global’s suc-\\ncess. In order to achieve the necessary improvements a four-phase plan was conceived.\\nFigure 2.11 gives an overview of the four phases.\\nPhase 1: Supply base reduction\\nBefore Global committed any substantial resource to develop its suppliers, it was\\nnecessary to reduce the number of companies that it dealt with. Reducing the number\\nof direct suppliers was essential to maximise the limited time and resources available. In\\norder to reduce the number of suppliers who dealt directly with Global, resourcing and\\ntiering activities were put in place. Suppliers were selected for the ongoing supply base\\non the following criteria:\\nppm defects (quality performance);\\nability to operate with kanban system (delivery performance);\\ncomputer aided design/manufacture (CAD/CAM) facilities (new product development);\\nTable 2.7\\nFocused factory structure\\nLow volume\\nHigh volume\\nMaterial control\\nMRP\\nKanban\\nProduct codes\\n> 5,000\\n< 800\\nMaterial ﬂow\\nPush\\nPull\\nDemand predictability\\nLow\\nHigh\\nMinimum order quantity\\n1\\nPallet\\nService offer\\nMTO\\nMTS'),\n",

The high-volume factory introduced, with the assistance and\\nagreement of the suppliers, a two-bin, kanban material-ordering system. The support\\nof the suppliers in introducing the simple material-ordering system was an early\\nexample of greater integration of working practices within the supply base. Only\\nthrough the agreement of a new way of trading was it possible to stop posting weekly\\nMRP schedules, which were out of step with ‘real time’ customer demand. Introduction\\nof the kanban system reduced waste created by the delay in transmitting demand data.\\nSimilarly, waste related to inappropriate processing, unnecessary inventory, unneces-\\nsary motion, waiting and transporting was reduced.\\nPhase 3: Supplier development\\nIntroducing kanban proved to be an early and rewarding example of supplier develop-\\nment for Global and its suppliers. However, development was not limited to one-off,\\nfunctional improvements. Before improvements were attempted in the more compli-\\ncated arena of new product development, it was planned to introduce cross-functional\\nteams between Global and its supply base through team-building weekends. For\\nexample, the managing director of the main die-casting supplier attended a team-\\nbuilding weekend with Global engineers, sales people, manufacturing managers and\\nﬁnance personnel. This weekend experience prompted the die-caster to introduce team\\nbuilding within its own operation, thus helping to reduce new product development\\ntimes between the two companies.\\nPhase 4: Timely product development\\nLead times for new product development in the lighting industry in 1996 were typically\\n18–24 months. For an industry that was becoming more and more fashion conscious\\nthe time from concept to product delivery was proving costly in terms of competitive-\\nness in the market.\\nOne of the prime driving forces for Global’s new management approach towards\\nsuppliers was the desire to reduce time and cost to market drastically. Suppliers within\\nthis new ethos became involved at the concept stage for new products. Product devel-\\nopment activities became concurrent rather than sequential. Designers and engineers\\nof suppliers with CAD and CAM technologies began to interact directly with Global’s\\ndesigners and engineers at each stage of the development process. At the same time,\\nshopﬂoor operators became involved with designers to bring cohesion between design\\nTable 2.8\\nSupplier reduction ﬁgures\\nYear\\nNo. of suppliers\\n1995\\n267\\n1996\\n198\\n1997\\n132\\n1998\\n106\\n1999\\n< 100'),\n",

The result of these changes in approach, internally and externally,\\nwas a reduction in development lead times for standard production items from 18\\nmonths to 14 weeks by early 1999.\\nOutcomes\\nRestructuring Global’s approach to managing suppliers would have provided limited\\nbeneﬁts if it had not occurred in conjunction with changes to Global’s internal opera-\\ntions. For example, improvements in the efﬁciency of the supply chain in terms of intro-\\nducing a concept such as kanban would not have been as effective if a restructuring of\\nmanufacturing had not taken place at the same time. Simultaneous internal and exter-\\nnal changes propelled Global’s performance forward in terms of product development,\\ncost and lead-time reduction, as shown in Table 2.9.\\nThe performance improvements shown in Table 2.9 were achieved through the\\nefforts of both supplier and buyer alike. Integration of supply chain activities and infor-\\nmation ﬂows accelerated the implementation of lean practices such as kanban, which\\nin turn reduced the uncertainty in demand and improved relationships. Operational\\nimprovements followed a consistent and deliberate strategy of developing conﬁdence,\\ntrust and openness between Global and its suppliers. Those who were prepared to work\\nin partnership to develop improvements gained additional sales volumes, which in turn\\nincreased the interdependence of the parties.\\nImprovements in relational as well as operational performance developed a virtuous\\ncircle for both parties. Implementing pull scheduling in the supply base necessitated the\\nsimultaneous implementation of a partnering strategy. The demise of the traditional\\n‘arm’s length’ approach to managing the buyer–supplier exchange helped both parties\\nto improve their business volumes and performance over this period.\\n(Source: Jim Aitken, visiting Fellow, Cranﬁeld Centre for Logistics and SCM)\\nQuestions\\nThe next phase of development at Global addresses the continuing growth in\\ndemand for customised, non-standard products. Linked to an ever-increasing\\ndemand for customisation is the drive for shorter lead times and lower costs. With\\nincreasing globalisation of the lighting market, several parts of Global’s product port-\\nfolio became commodity in nature. Customers in the United Kingdom now have the\\nopportunity to purchase their lighting products from low labour cost countries such\\nTable 2.9 Changes between 1995 and 1998\\n1995\\n1998\\nMRP\\nKanban\\nProduct codes\\n8000\\x02\\n>5000\\n>800\\nProduct development\\n24 months\\n6 months\\n6 months\\nDelivery lead times\\n8–12 weeks\\n2–4 weeks\\n0–2 weeks\\nCosts (1995 index \\x03 100)\\n100\\n85\\n73\\nSales volume (1995 index \\x03 100)\\n100\\n110\\n125'),\n",

Historically, promotional events in BTC were a fairly hit and miss affair with hundreds of products being promoted within a four-week window. There was a high reliance on good luck for all the elements to come together prior to the start of the promotional period. Inevitably some products, display aids and show material arrived late. Store operations at the end of the supply chain then had to try and mount the promotions with what had been delivered. Consumers were dissatisﬁed with the result and sales were lost. The solution was to create a dedicated promotions team within the categories. The team masterminded the overall promotional plan and were made responsible for the delivery of products, display aids and show materials into the national distribution cen- tres (NDCs). A successful trial was then conducted whereby most of the work required to mount the promotion was done by logistics staff in the regional distribution centres (RDCs) for each of the individual stores. The trial comprised sending allocations of all the promotional requirements to the RDCs from the NDCs. Staff in the RDCs then picked products for a week’s anticipated sales (based on historical data for that line by individual store) into totes for direct-to- shelf delivery together with appropriate display aids and show material. The totes were then placed on dollies, rolled on and off vehicles, and wheeled into the shop to the cor- rect gondola end (end of free-standing ‘island’ shelf in a store). After three days, EPOS data was reviewed, and an accurate prediction of future sales to the end of the pro- motion was made. This was then used to calculate future replenishment requirements. Finally the merchandising teams were invited to devise clever ways to make shelves look full at the end of the promotion without using a lot of stock. This resulted in fewer ‘remainders’ from a promotion that had to be written down.

Stage 1\\nhad been the basic product: a sealed lead-acid battery for use in mining applications.\\nBatteries were regarded by customers as a mature product and as a ‘grudge buy’. Each\\nyear, the basic product was under heavy downward price pressure. Stage 2 had been\\nthe industry reaction to customer service: the addition of warranty replacement of\\ndefective products, of quality assurance (QA) audits of a supplier’s design and manu-\\nfacturing processes, and of parts and service provision.\\nStage 3 had recognised the need to go much further in terms of customer service. A\\nwhole raft of additional services had been conceived with a view to adding value.\\nBreakdowns were ﬁxed at short notice by means of ﬁeld service engineers. Everglo\\nproducts could now be delivered and installed at customer premises. Price lists were\\nsimpliﬁed by including peripheral equipment, such as contactors, that had to be added\\nto a battery rack in order to make it work. Advice and tips were added to help cus-\\ntomers warm to Everglo products. In a proactive move, Everglo introduced charts and\\nadvice about the application of battery products in general, and the resulting tables\\nbecame an industry standard. Parts and service in the ﬁeld were upgraded to a ’24-\\nhour, no-nonsense back-up service’. And customer training built on Everglo’s position\\nas an industry leader. Rather than sales seminars, Everglo’s were customer training sem-\\ninars, where the company spoke on behalf of the industry rather than as a supplier.\\nIn spite of having reached a pre-eminent position in mining power supply, Everglo\\nrecognised that the centre of Figure 2.5 was in effect a ‘black hole’.

While Philips initially rejected offers of help\\nfrom Nokia, it soon became apparent that production delays would be much more\\nthan one week. Korhonen put together a team to ﬁnd solutions to supplying the ﬁve\\nchips that were affected by the Philips ﬁre. Three were quickly re-sourced from Japanese\\nand American suppliers, but the other two were only supplied by Philips. This time\\nPhilips cooperated at the highest level.

Factories at Eindhoven and at Shanghai were rescheduled to\\nsupply the missing chips, and engineers from both Nokia and Philips worked to accel-\\nerate the return of the Albuquerque plant to full production. As a result of these inten-\\nsive efforts, there were relatively minor delays to Nokia’s cellphone shipments.\\nExecutives at Ericsson in Sweden only learned of the problem several weeks after the\\nﬁre. Company culture was less proactive than at its Finnish rival. The bad news was\\nwithheld from senior management long after it became clear that delays were becom-\\ning serious. By the time that Ericsson realised the magnitude of the problem, it was too\\nlate to ﬁnd alternative sources.

This means that alternative routes for suppliers to deliver to its Burnaston\\nassembly plant in the UK have been planned in advance to deal, for example,\\nwith a French channel ferry strike at Calais. The weather is also a cause of uncer-\\ntainty in logistics – for example, it may mean that Tesco has to switch between\\nsalads and soups as the result of a cold snap.

So man-\\nagement strategies for the supply chain require a more holistic look at the links,\\nand an understanding that organisational boundaries easily create barriers to\\nﬂow.\\nCase study 1.2 describes how one company – Xerox in this case – re-engineered\\nmaterial ﬂow in its distribution system.\\nMaterial ﬂow and information ﬂow\\n13\\nXerox\\nOnce the problems of introducing ‘just-in-time’ production systems had been solved at\\nthe Xerox plant making photocopiers at Venray in Holland, attention shifted towards\\nthe ﬁnished product inventory. Historically, stocks of ﬁnished products had been ‘man-\\naged’ by trying to turn the tap of sales on or off as stocks developed. This was charac-\\nterised by the familiar ‘feast or famine’ situations. The objective of the next move for\\nXerox became clear: making only what you need when you need it, then shipping\\ndirect to the customer. But the key question had to be answered: just-in-time for what?\\nThe answer is – the end-customer. And customer surveys showed that three types of\\ndelivery were needed:\\n●\\nCommodity products should be delivered ‘off the shelf’.\\n●\\nMiddle-range products were required in ﬁve days.\\n●\\nLarger products that had to be integrated into existing customer processes and sys-\\ntems had to be planned months ahead: but the quoted delivery date had to be met\\n100 per cent.\\nIt was envisaged that this would lead to a radically different inventory ‘proﬁle’ in the\\nsupply chain. Figure 1.6 shows a traditional inventory proﬁle on the left. Most of the\\nstock was held in local depots waiting for customer orders. If the mix had been incor-\\nrectly forecast, too many of the wrong products were in plentiful supply, while needed\\nproducts were unavailable. Further, a batch of replacement products would take a long\\ntime to ﬁght their way through the pipeline. A new ‘just-in-time’ strategy was con-\\nceived to make the supply chain much more responsive. This strategy had a profound\\neffect on the inventory proﬁle, pushing much of the inventory away from the end-cus-\\ntomer (where it has maximum added value and is already committed to a given ﬁn-\\nished product speciﬁcation). Instead, inventory was mostly held further upstream,\\nwhere it could be ﬁnally assembled to known orders, and where it had lower value. Of\\ncourse, it has since been possible to remove several of the stages of the distribution\\nprocess, thereby eliminating some of the sources of inventory altogether.\\nFor commodity products, Xerox coined the term deliver JIT: that is, the product had\\nto be delivered out of stock. Where sales forecasts are traditionally poor, the challenge\\nwas one of ﬂexibility, simplicity and speed of manufacture.

       "   'Controlling variability: the dependability advantage\\nTime is not just about speed. Quality is not just about meeting defect targets.\\nBehind both ‘hard’ objectives is the need to control variability in logistics pro-\\ncesses. Variability undermines the dependability with which a product or service\\nmeets target. While Vision Express offers a one-hour service for prescription\\nglasses, the 95 per cent service level is a measure of the dependability of that serv-\\nice against the one-hour target. Firms who do not offer instantaneous availability\\nneed to tell the customer – in other words to ‘promise’ – when the product or serv-\\nice will be delivered. Delivery dependability measures how successful the ﬁrm has\\nbeen in meeting those promises. For example, the UK’s Royal Mail offers a ‘ﬁrst\\nclass’ service for letters whereby there is a 90 per cent probability that a letter\\nposted today will reach its destination tomorrow. It is important to measure\\ndependability in the same ‘end to end’ way that speed is measured.\\nDependability measures are widely used in industries such as train and air travel\\nservices to monitor how well published timetables are met. And in manufactur-\\ning ﬁrms, dependability is used to monitor a supplier’s performance in such\\nterms as:\\n●on time (percentage of orders delivered on time, and the variability against\\ntarget);\\n●in full (percentage of orders delivered complete, and the variability against\\ntarget);\\n●on quality (percentage of defects, and the variability against target).\\nSo logistics is concerned not just with the average percentage of orders delivered\\non time but also with the variability. For example, a manufacturer has to cope\\nwith the day-to-day variability of orders placed. In practice, this is more import-\\nant than the average orders placed because of the resource implications of ‘ups\\nand downs’ in demand. Case study 1.3 explores the impact of variability on a\\nsupplier’s processes.\\nCompeting through logistics\\n19\\nMeasuring schedule variability\\nA problem that is all too familiar to suppliers in the automotive industry is that of sched-\\nule variability. A vehicle manufacturer issues delivery schedules to specify how many\\nparts of each type are required each day for the following month. And each day a ‘call-\\noff’ quantity is issued, which speciﬁes how many the vehicle manufacturer actually\\nwants. The two sets of ﬁgures are not necessarily the same, although they usually add\\nup to the same cumulative numbers for the month as a whole. In other words, the total\\nscheduled quantities and the total call-off quantities are the same. So what is the prob-\\nlem?\\nThe problem is that the supplier has to cope with ups and downs of call-off quantities\\nthat create huge problems for the supplier’s process. Let scheduled demand = S, and\\ncall-off quantities \\x04 A. Then the difference D between schedule and actual is given by\\nD = S – A.

CleanCo currently segments its customers on the value of customer\\naccounts. The primary division is between national accounts, for which 10 accounts\\nconstitute 70 per cent of sales by value, and ﬁeld sales, which comprise a long ‘tail’ of\\nmore than 200 accounts that together make up only 30 per cent of sales. Due to the\\nsize of the ﬁeld sales structure, a secondary classiﬁcation groups accounts by channel\\ntype: neighbourhood retail, discount and pharmacy. CleanCo recognises the need to\\nreduce the long customer ‘tail’ and is introducing distributors for orders below a mini-\\nmum quantity. CleanCo’s current approach to segmentation is summarised in Table\\n2.3.\\nWhile CleanCo currently segments its retail customers by account size, its sales organ-\\nisation has identiﬁed two signiﬁcant types of buying behaviour displayed by the cus-\\ntomer base, shown in Table 2.4:\\n●\\nvolume-driven buying behaviour;\\n●\\nmargin-driven buying behaviour.\\nVolume-driven customers are keen to capitalise on both product and supply chain cost\\nsavings in order to pass them on to their customers to drive volume sales. There are two\\nvariants of the volume-driven behaviour:\\n●\\neveryday low price (EDLP);\\n●\\ndiscount.\\nRetailers pursuing an EDLP strategy strive for continuous price reduction from sup-\\npliers like CleanCo to drive a fairly consistent, high volume of sales. This should result\\nin a relatively stable pattern of demand in the washing and bathing sector. Discounters\\non the other hand are looking for bargains so they can ‘stack ‘em high and sell ‘em\\ncheap’, a strategy more likely to result in a volatile demand pattern. Margin-driven cus-\\ntomers are keen to add value for their customers by offering a wide selection of prod-\\nucts and value-adding services. This strategy also results in a relatively stable demand\\npattern in this sector.\\nCASE STUDY\\n2.3\\nTable 2.3\\nCleanCo – Current approach to market segmentation\\nNational accounts\\nField sales\\n70% sales\\n30% sales, 200+\\naccounts\\n10 accounts\\nNeighbourhood retail\\nDiscount sector\\nPharmacy\\nTable 2.4\\nCleanCo – potential for behavioural segmentation\\nVolume-driven\\nMargin-driven\\nEvery day low price (EDLP)\\nDiscount'],\n",

However, in Europe, most retailers have\\nfound that customers enjoy promotions and that promotions boost sales. In any case,\\nevents like Christmas and back to school create huge surges in demand.\\nEvents may be divided in two: seasonal events and promotional events, as shown in\\nTable 2.1:\\nRetailers have no control over the timing of seasonal events and it is usually very dif-\\nﬁcult to forecast likely demand with normal levels of accuracy. In contrast, promotional\\nevents are planned by retailers and their suppliers. Consequently, while demand may\\nbe unpredictable, the timing of such events is known in advance. It is surprising, there-\\nfore, how often consumers will ﬁnd that items on promotion are not on the shelf and\\nthat display aids and promotional material will be missing. The event which has the\\ngreatest effect is Christmas – where sales usually start growing in October, ramp up in\\nNovember and peak in December. This is the only proﬁtable quarter for many retailers.\\nThe product is frequently sourced from the Far East and once the order has been deliv-\\nered there will be no further shipments. Retailers need to plan for this activity months\\nin advance and cross their ﬁngers that they will not miss sales through under-ordering\\nCASE STUDY\\n2.1\\nTable 2.1 Example seasonal events and promotions\\nSeasonal events\\nPromotions\\n●Valentine’s Day\\n●Three for two\\n●Mother’s Day\\n●Buy one get one free\\n●Summer holidays\\n●10% off for a week\\n●Back to school\\n●Happy hour – 20%\\n●Christmas',\n",

The ﬂow of the product into the distribution centre\\nis broken into four waves and speciﬁc products are delivered in different cycles through\\nthe day.

A\\nnew distribution strategy was needed.\\nUnder the ‘composite’ distribution system, many small depots with limited tempera-\\nture control facilities were replaced by composite distribution centres (called regional\\ndistribution centres, RDCs), which can handle many products at several temperature\\nranges. The opportunity is to provide a cost-effective daily delivery service to all stores.\\nTypically, a composite distribution centre can handle over 60 million cases per year on\\na 15-acre site. The warehouse building comprises 25,000 square metres divided into\\nthree temperature zones: frozen (\\x0225°C), \\x032°C (chilled) and \\x0312°C (semi-ambient).\\nEach distribution centre (DC) serves a group of between 100 and 140 retail stores.\\nDelivery vehicles for composite depots can use insulated trailers divided into chambers\\nby means of movable bulkheads so they can operate at different temperatures.\\nDeliveries are made at agreed, scheduled times. Ambient goods such as cans and cloth-\\ning are delivered through a separate grocery distribution network which relies on a\\nstocked environment where orders are picked by store. This operation is complemented\\nby a strategically located trunking station which operates a pick to zero operation for\\nfast-moving grocery on merchandise units that can be placed directly on the shop ﬂoor.\\nSo much for the method of transporting goods from supplier through to the stores,\\nbut how much should be sent to each store? With such a huge product range today, it\\nis impossible for the individual store to reorder across the whole range (store-based\\nordering). Instead, sales of each product line are tracked continuously through the till\\nby means of electronic point of sale (EPOS) systems. As a customer’s purchases are\\nscanned through the bar code reader at the till, the sale is automatically recorded for\\neach sku. Cumulative sales are updated every four hours on Tesco Information\\nExchange (TIE). This is a system based on Internet Protocol that allows Tesco and its\\nsuppliers to communicate trading information. The aim of improved communication is\\nto reduce response times from manufacturer to stores and to ensure product availability\\non the shelf. Among other things, TIE aims to improve processes for introducing new\\nproducts and promotions, and to monitor service levels.\\nBased on the cumulative sales, Tesco places orders with its suppliers by means of elec-\\ntronic data interchange (EDI). As volumes and product ranges increased during the\\n1990s, food retailers such as Tesco aimed to destock their distribution centres by order-\\ning only what was needed to meet tomorrow’s forecast sales.
