        "\n",
        "**Description:** Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) is a prompting technique designed to improve the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by explicitly prompting the model to generate a draft response, then generate verification questions for its own response, answer those questions independently of the initial draft, and finally use the answers to revise and improve the original draft. This creates a self-correction mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas:** Tasks requiring high factual accuracy and reduced hallucination, such as question answering, summarization of factual information, and generating reports or summaries based on provided text. It is particularly useful when dealing with complex or potentially ambiguous information where the model might otherwise confidently generate incorrect details.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:**\n",
        "- When factual accuracy is critical and errors could be harmful or misleading.\n",
        "- To reduce hallucinations and improve the reliability of the model's output.\n",
        "- When verifying information against external sources is not immediately feasible or desired within the prompting process itself.\n",
        "- For generating summaries or answers that require synthesizing information from multiple potential points within the model's knowledge or context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works:**\n",
        "1. **Generate Initial Draft:** The model first generates a direct answer or response to the original prompt.\n",
        "2. **Generate Verification Questions:** The model is then prompted to generate questions that would help verify the correctness of the statements made in the initial draft.\n",
        "3. **Answer Verification Questions:** The model answers these verification questions *independently* of the initial draft, drawing from its internal knowledge or provided context. This step is crucial as it prevents the model from simply confirming its own potential errors.\n",
        "4. **Revise Initial Draft:** The model compares the answers to the verification questions with the original draft and revises the draft to align with the verified information.\n",
        "\n",
        "This iterative process helps the model identify inconsistencies or inaccuracies in its initial output and correct them before presenting the final response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example (Conceptual):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt: \"Explain the process of photosynthesis and its main outputs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initial Draft (Internal):** \"Photosynthesis is how plants make food. They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The main output is oxygen and sugar.\" (Might contain slight inaccuracies or missing details).\n",
        "2.  **Generate Verification Questions (Internal):**\n",
        "    *   \"What are the inputs of photosynthesis?\"\n",
        "    *   \"What are the outputs of photosynthesis?\"\n",
        "    *   \"What is the role of chlorophyll?\"\n",
        "    *   \"Where does photosynthesis primarily occur in a plant?\"\n",
        "3.  **Answer Verification Questions (Internal, independently):**\n",
        "    *   \"Inputs are carbon dioxide, water, and light energy.\"\n",
        "    *   \"Outputs are glucose (a sugar) and oxygen.\"\n",
        "    *   \"Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs light energy.\"\n",
        "    *   \"It occurs mainly in chloroplasts within plant cells.\"\n",
        "4.  **Revise Initial Draft (Internal, based on verified answers):** \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and light energy from the sun. Using the energy absorbed by chlorophyll in their chloroplasts, they convert these inputs into glucose, a sugar they use for energy and growth, and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct.\"\n",

            "- **Purpose:** Hedging foreign exchange exposure\n",
            "\n",
            "**Potential Benefits:**\n",
            "1. **Hedging:** The primary purpose of the trade is to hedge foreign exchange exposure, which can stabilize cash flows and protect against adverse currency movements.\n",
            "2. **Market Positioning:** If the client anticipates a depreciation of the USD against the EUR, this trade could be beneficial in locking in favorable rates.\n",
            "3. **Liquidity Management:** The trade can help manage liquidity needs by providing certainty around future cash flows.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Immediate Red Flags:**\n",
            "1. **Credit Risk:** The size of the notional value ($100,000,000) raises concerns about counterparty credit risk, especially if the client has a lower credit rating.\n",
            "2. **Regulatory Compliance:** The trade must comply with relevant regulations (Dodd-Frank, EMIR) regarding reporting and clearing requirements for derivatives.\n",
            "3. **Market Conditions:** The pricing of the FX forward must reflect current market conditions and volatility; any discrepancies could indicate potential issues.\n",
            "4. **Internal Risk Limits:** The trade must be assessed against the bank's internal risk limits for foreign exchange exposure and counterparty risk.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Is the counterparty's credit risk within acceptable limits for a trade of this size and tenor?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Review the client's credit rating and risk profile. If the client has a low credit rating (e.g., below investment grade), the trade may exceed acceptable risk limits. A thorough credit assessment should be conducted, including potential collateral requirements.\n",

            "2. **Does this trade comply with all relevant regulatory requirements for derivative transactions?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Confirm that the trade is reported to the appropriate trade repositories and that it meets clearing requirements under Dodd-Frank and EMIR. If the notional exceeds certain thresholds, it may require central clearing.\n",

            "3. **Does the pricing of this derivative accurately reflect current market conditions and volatility?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Analyze the current market rates for the EUR/USD pair and compare them with the proposed pricing of the FX forward. Ensure that the pricing incorporates current volatility and market expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **How does this trade impact the bank's overall exposure to the underlying asset?**\n",
            "   - **Answer:** Assess the bank's existing exposure to the EUR/USD pair. If the bank already has significant exposure, this trade could exacerbate risk. A comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted to evaluate the overall impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Are the operational processes and systems in place to handle the settlement and ongoing management of this specific derivative type?**\n",

            "6. **Has the client undergone the necessary suitability and appropriateness checks for complex products like this?**\n",

            "- **Regulatory Compliance:** If the trade meets all regulatory requirements, it can proceed; otherwise, adjustments must be made.\n",
            "- **Market Pricing:** If the pricing is aligned with market conditions, the trade is viable; if not, renegotiation may be required.\n",
            "- **Overall Exposure:** If the trade increases the bank's exposure beyond acceptable limits, it may need to be reconsidered or adjusted.\n",
            "- **Operational Readiness:** If operational processes are in place, the trade can be executed; if not, further preparations are needed.\n",

The model then uses the Observation to inform its next Thought and Action.\n"
